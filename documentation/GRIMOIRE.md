# Markei Operational Grimoire

## 1. Purpose

The GRIMOIRE is Markei's human-supervised operational interface. It reduces
repeated terminal typing without hiding provider selection, identity, secret
entry, mutation authority, or expected evidence.

```text
human selects one indexed block
→ block identifies its canonical GENERAL_SCRIPTS procedure
→ NS_COORDINATES supplies reviewed non-secret values
→ terminal requests only missing role/UUID/secret input
→ reviewed launcher or query performs the operation
→ sanitized output is compared with the stated expectation
→ operator stops on any mismatch
```

The system is hemi-automated: scripts own mechanical checks; the human owns
target confirmation and mutation authority.

## 2. Canonical five-file system

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `documentation/GRIMOIRE.md` | System architecture, safety policy, usage guidance, and final concise execution index |
| `documentation/GENERAL_SCRIPTS.md` | Canonical expanded `GS-*` procedures and validation sequences |
| `documentation/NS_COORDINATES.md` | Strict allowlist of public/non-secret coordinates and lifecycle metadata |
| `documentation/NEON_CHECK.ps1` | Windows-proven launcher: coordinate loading, menus, masked secret input, Docker `psql`, transport enforcement, preflight, and dispatch |
| `documentation/NEON_ACTION.sql` | SQL-only indexed `NA-*` read-only action catalogue |

`NEON_ACTION.sql` remains the canonical singular filename. Historical
`NEON_ACTIONS.sql` wording does not create another interface.

The former `documentation/models/` and duplicate legacy execution layers were
pruned after their proven behavior was promoted into this set. Git and J retain
the historical evidence; the live tree retains one executable owner.

## 3. Interface hierarchy and identifiers

The three indexes serve different altitudes:

| Index | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `GRM-*` | Human-facing concise invocation block in `GRIMOIRE_INDEX` |
| `GS-*` | Canonical expanded command/query in `GENERAL_SCRIPTS.md` |
| `NA-*` | SQL-only action block in `NEON_ACTION.sql` |

Example:

```text
GRM-NEON-04
→ GENERAL_SCRIPTS.md / GS-NEON-04
→ NEON_CHECK.ps1 -Action gate02-postflight
→ NEON_ACTION.sql / NA-03
```

Treat all IDs, coordinate keys, action names, role names, and paths as one
versioned interface. Reconcile every live reference in the same focused change
when one changes.

## 4. Coordinate and secret policy

`NS_COORDINATES.md` contains only the minimum non-secret values needed to
identify repository, Render, Auth0, Neon, hosted-contract, and migration
surfaces. It retains every coordinate from the original `NEON_CRED.md` and adds
explicit lifecycle, acquisition, and exposure guidance.

Repository-safe does not mean consequence-free. The direct Neon hostname,
database name, and role names cannot authenticate anyone, but together reveal
the development topology. They remain committed under the approved
mitigated-risk policy and should not be redistributed unnecessarily.

Never commit:

- passwords or complete database URLs;
- tokens, client secrets, API keys, private keys, cookies, or authorization
  headers;
- real user subjects or account/device/submission/event UUIDs;
- environment dumps, provider screenshots, or terminal transcripts containing
  excluded values.

Current private input surface:

```text
documentation/SECRET_INPUTS.md
```

It remains ignored and untracked. Reviewed commands do not parse it
automatically; secrets are requested only when an operation needs them.

## 5. First setup

1. Keep the five canonical files together under `documentation/`.
2. Fill only independently verified non-secret placeholders in
   `NS_COORDINATES.md`.
3. Keep provider secrets outside the repository.
4. Start Docker Desktop.
5. Open PowerShell in the repository root.
6. Run the read-only migrator connection proof:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File ".\documentation\NEON_CHECK.ps1" `
  -ConfigPath ".\documentation\NS_COORDINATES.md" `
  -Role migrator `
  -Action connection
```

The execution-policy bypass applies only to the child PowerShell process. If
organizational policy blocks it, use the locally approved signed-script route.

## 6. Runtime input model

The procedures fetch stable non-secret values automatically:

```text
repository branch
Render public origin and route paths
Auth0 issuer/audience/public metadata paths
Neon environment/branch/host/port/database
PostgreSQL major version
runtime/migrator/owner role names
TLS and channel-binding policy
API contract and migration coordinates
```

The terminal requests only values that must not be persisted or that identify
one exact local operation:

| Runtime input | Acquisition |
| --- | --- |
| Neon role | Fixed by command or selected from the guided menu |
| Neon role password | Masked `Read-Host -AsSecureString` prompt |
| Device UUID | Local prompt only for `verify-device` |
| Migration authorization | Exact `APPLY-ONCE` phrase after dashboard target confirmation |
| Auth0 access token | Session-only masked handling in a separately reviewed procedure; no active index command yet |

The launcher temporarily exposes a role password to the Docker child through
`PGPASSWORD`, removes the container after the command, zeroes the BSTR, and
clears PostgreSQL process variables in `finally`.

## 7. Neon launcher behavior

The launcher:

1. resolves `NS_COORDINATES.md` and `NEON_ACTION.sql` beside itself;
2. validates Docker availability;
3. selects or validates the role and action;
4. reads the unique coordinate keys;
5. locks execution to `Environment: development`;
6. requires the direct `ep-*.neon.tech` hostname;
7. requires PostgreSQL 18, TLS `require`, and channel binding `require`;
8. prompts for the selected role password;
9. authenticates through `postgres:18-alpine`;
10. proves exact PostgreSQL role and database identity;
11. executes one SQL action, shell, or separately authorized migration;
12. returns a `PASS` marker or a terminal failure.

The launcher displays the intended Neon branch alias but cannot independently
prove it from the PostgreSQL connection. Confirm the human-readable branch in
Neon before any mutation.

## 8. Role boundaries

| Role | Routine purpose | Must not become |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `runtime` | Hosted API identity and least-privilege checks | Migration identity |
| `migrator` | Migrations, ledger, catalogue, and provider inspection | Render runtime identity |
| `dbowner` | Explicit owner-only recovery | Default operational role |

Gate 02 and migration actions are locked to `migrator`.

## 9. SQL action architecture

`NEON_ACTION.sql` remains valid SQL. All explanations are SQL comments. Each
action uses both a human index and the parser contract:

```sql
-- NA-03 | GATE 02 POSTFLIGHT
-- ACTION: gate02-postflight
...
-- END ACTION
```

The launcher extracts only the selected `ACTION` block. Routine blocks begin
with `BEGIN TRANSACTION READ ONLY` and terminate with `ROLLBACK`.

To change the catalogue:

1. preserve the exact action markers;
2. return sanitized evidence only;
3. prefer a read-only transaction;
4. update the `NA-*` block index;
5. update PowerShell `ValidateSet` and `$Actions` only if an action name changes;
6. update its `GS-*` canonical procedure and `GRM-*` block;
7. test against the disposable development target.

## 10. Migration boundary

`apply-migration` accepts a path rather than embedding SQL. It verifies that
the migration:

- lives inside the current repository;
- is tracked by Git;
- has no uncommitted changes;
- has the expected `.sql` extension.

It then prints the resolved path and SHA-256, displays the selected non-secret
environment/branch/database coordinates, and requires the exact phrase
`APPLY-ONCE`.

Migration `007_account_cursor_provisioning` was applied once on 2026-07-23 and
passed postflight. Its command remains historical evidence in
`GENERAL_SCRIPTS.md` and is intentionally absent from `GRIMOIRE_INDEX`.

## 11. Gate 02 proven checkpoint

The development database returned:

- migration 007 ledger checksum
  `c10-mcg02-account-cursor-provisioning-v1`;
- readiness-v2 `true`;
- one provisioning function and exactly one provisioning trigger;
- one Account and one corresponding cursor-state row;
- zero missing cursor-state rows and zero orphan cursor-state rows;
- runtime `SELECT=true`, `INSERT=false`, `DELETE=false`;
- runtime scoped `next_cursor UPDATE=true`;
- runtime readiness execution `true`;
- runtime privileged provisioning execution `false`.

The `false` values are intended security boundaries. Gate 02 is closed;
migration 007 must not be reapplied.

## 12. Failure classifications

| Failure | Meaning / next move |
| --- | --- |
| Docker unavailable | Start Docker Desktop; no provider call occurred |
| Coordinate placeholder remains | Verify and fill only that non-secret value |
| Authentication rejected | Confirm selected role and current rotated password |
| Role/database mismatch | Stop; target coordinate or credential is wrong |
| TLS/channel binding mismatch | Stop; do not open a shell or mutate |
| PostgreSQL version mismatch | Stop; launcher proof is pinned to major 18 |
| Migration dirty/untracked | Restore an exact committed migration |
| Migration reports an error | Do not retry; inspect ledger/postflight read-only |
| Neon branch uncertainty | Stop and verify the dashboard branch |
| Render origin/branch mismatch | Stop before deployment or Sync |
| Auth0 metadata mismatch | Stop before using a token |
| Health response mismatch | Stop before authenticated requests |

## 13. Maintenance and validation rule

Search the active five-file interface after every change:

```powershell
rg "NS_COORDINATES|NEON_CHECK|NEON_ACTION|GRM-|GS-|NA-" `
  documentation\GRIMOIRE.md `
  documentation\GENERAL_SCRIPTS.md `
  documentation\NS_COORDINATES.md `
  documentation\NEON_CHECK.ps1 `
  documentation\NEON_ACTION.sql
```

Historical `NEON_CRED.md` references in J or Git history are observational
records; do not rewrite them as if the old filename had never existed.

## GRIMOIRE_INDEX

Index policy:

- Every active block has one `GRM-*` ID and functionality name.
- Sub-header `01` names the canonical `GS-*` command/query and hosting path.
- Only the fenced **Copy-paste-ready body** is intended for machine input.
- Explanations, required variables, and expected results stay outside the body.
- Bodies contain no secret and no manually edited placeholder.
- Mutations already completed, including migration 007, are excluded.
