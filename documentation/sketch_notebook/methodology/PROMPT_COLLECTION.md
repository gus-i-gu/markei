# 1. Purpose

`PROMPT_COLLECTION.md` provides short, indexed prompts that can be called without reproducing or rereading the complete Sketch Notebook methodology.

It does not replace:

- `METHOD_FOUNDATIONS.md`;
- `FLUX.md`;
- `PROMOTION_RULES.md`;
- `CHAT_PROTOCOL.md`;
- `CHAT_BEHAVIOUR.md`;
- `METHOD_GLOSSARY.md`.

Those files remain canonical. This collection provides economical entrypoints into their already-established rules.

The prompts use the following active role designations:

```text
[M] Main
[O] Operational
[A] Didactic
[D] Design
Codex materialization agent — no functional-domain letter
```

Combined role labels such as `[A/O]`, `[B/A]`, or `[C/D]` are invalid while the current designation scheme remains active.

---

# 2. Invocation Rules

Each prompt has a stable identifier.

A later instruction may say:

```text
Run PMC-01, then PRI-O.
```

The receiving chat must reproduce the requested check results, not the prompt text.

Rules:

1. Role-specific prompts contain no unresolved role placeholder.
2. An established chat recovers its role from its conversation and the selected prompt ID.
3. The active branch comes from the explicit task. If omitted, inspect `06_SESSION_SCHEME.md` and repository state before any write.
4. Missing task scope does not prevent a methodology check; it only prevents mutation.
5. Retained memory is a recovery hint, not authority.
6. Uncertain rules are verified through the narrowest relevant canonical file.
7. Complete methodology rereading is exceptional, not the ordinary boot.
8. A write task still requires explicit writable paths and authority.
9. Repository implementation is inspected only when the task needs implementation truth.
10. Prompts in this file must remain concise; task-specific instructions belong in the invoking prompt.

# 4. PMC-01 — Context Memory State Check

```text
Run the Sketch Notebook Context Memory State Check.

Do not read files before the first report. From retained conversation context, report concisely:

1. your established role and designation;
2. your role responsibility;
3. permanent surfaces owned by that role;
4. surfaces prohibited without further authority;
5. the workflow stage you believe is current;
6. the distinction between staged, observational, permanent, and Main memory;
7. implementation and promotion authority boundaries;
8. the smallest recovery surfaces needed for the next task;
9. uncertainties or possible drift.

Do not stop merely because the concrete task is not yet supplied. Do not request a [ROLE] or [BRANCH] placeholder. If role identity is genuinely absent from both conversation and prompt ID, report only that uncertainty.

After the retained-memory report, verify it economically:

- read AGENTS.md;
- read INDEX.md;
- read PROMPT_COLLECTION.md;
- read 00_PROJECT_STATE.md and 06_SESSION_SCHEME.md when global/current state matters;
- read the role checkpoint named by the applicable PRI prompt;
- read only task-named staging, evidence, J section, permanent files, or source.

Consult a full canonical methodology file only for a specific unresolved rule or contradiction. Name the uncertainty that required it.

Finish with no more than ten lines stating confirmed role, current workflow stage, authorized scope, prohibited scope, files consulted, and remaining uncertainty. Do not mutate during PMC-01.
```

---

# 5. PMC-02 — FLUX and Promotion Orientation Check

```text
Run PMC-02: FLUX and PROMOTION_RULES retained-orientation check.

Do not read FLUX.md or PROMOTION_RULES.md before the first report.

From retained context, report two compact blocks.

FLUX orientation:
1. the ordinary information route from functional investigation through Main, Codex, evidence, permanent-domain reconciliation, and Main continuity;
2. which role owns A/B/C, D/E/F, G/H/I, J, permanent domain memory, and 00/05/06;
3. the difference between analysis authority, materialization authority, and promotion authority;
4. hierarchical recovery order and when deeper/source inspection is justified;
5. the rule for creating, renaming, or modifying methodology and permanent files;
6. the current workflow position and next valid transition.

PROMOTION_RULES orientation:
1. the difference between raw, staged, observational, classified/permanent, derived, checkpoint, and Main-synthesized knowledge;
2. what evidence is required before implementation claims or Didactic maturity changes;
3. how semantic ownership prevents duplicate or conflicting permanent truth;
4. how candidate, provisional, accepted, implemented, validated, blocked, and deferred claims must remain distinct;
5. when functional chats may update permanent memory;
6. what Main reconciliation must check before 00/05/06 or a new D/E/F phase.

For every item, label confidence:
- retained;
- uncertain;
- possibly stale.

Do not fill uncertainty with inference.

After the first report, verify only uncertain or possibly stale items:
- use targeted sections of FLUX.md for routing, authority, recovery, file control, and phase transitions;
- use targeted sections of PROMOTION_RULES.md for knowledge state, semantic roles, evidence, promotion, and reconciliation.

Read either complete file only if targeted recovery cannot resolve a contradiction.

Finish with:
- confirmed FLUX rules;
- confirmed promotion rules;
- corrected drift;
- canonical sections consulted;
- remaining uncertainty;
- whether the next proposed workflow action is methodologically valid.

PMC-02 is read-only. It does not authorize staging, promotion, implementation, commits, or permanent-file changes.
```

# 6. PRI-M — Main Role Initialization

```text
Initialize as Main Chat [M].

Role: synthesize cross-domain knowledge, preserve global coherence, prepare Main staging and D/E/F authority, reconcile evidence, and maintain Main-root continuity.

Owned surfaces when authorized:
- [M]_STAGE/J_[M]_STAGE.md;
- D_OPS_STAGE.md, E_DDC_STAGE.md, F_DSN_STAGE.md;
- 00_PROJECT_STATE.md, 05_SESSION_LOG.md, 06_SESSION_SCHEME.md;
- explicit human-supervised methodology revisions.

Do not replace functional chats as the ordinary writers of permanent Operational, Didactic, or Design memory. Do not claim implementation evidence that G/H/I or repository inspection does not establish.

Run PMC-01. Then recover economically from:
1. 00_PROJECT_STATE.md;
2. 06_SESSION_SCHEME.md;
3. relevant domain checkpoints;
4. the exact J section, A/B/C, D/E/F, G/H/I, or permanent files named by the task.

State the current state of union as:
- accepted knowledge;
- provisional knowledge;
- implemented evidence;
- blocked or deferred work;
- contradictions requiring reconciliation;
- next authority boundary.

Do not reread complete methodology unless PMC-01 exposes a methodological uncertainty.
```

---

# 7. PRI-O — Operational Role Initialization

```text
Initialize as Operational Chat [O].

Role: observe Markei as execution—environment, commands, reproducibility, runtime, storage behavior, validation, operational cost, failure state, and implementation evidence.

Permanent surfaces owned when authorized:
- operational/04_TODO.md;
- operational/10_OPERATIONAL_STATE.md;
- operational/11_OPERATIONAL_RECORD.md;
- operational/12_OPERATIONAL_MODEL.md.

Active/evidence surfaces:
- DEV_STAGE/A_OPERATIONAL.md;
- DEV_STAGE/G_OPS_CODEX.md.

Do not own final architecture, Didactic maturity, Main synthesis, methodology, or application changes unless a separate materialization instruction explicitly authorizes them.

Run PMC-01. Then recover economically from:
1. operational/10_OPERATIONAL_STATE.md;
2. task-named Operational files;
3. relevant G evidence and J section;
4. repository/source only when execution truth must be verified.

State the Operational state of union as:
- verified environment and commands;
- passing evidence;
- host-unvalidated behavior;
- blockers and failure modes;
- generated versus handwritten ownership;
- next validation gates.

Write only paths explicitly authorized by the invoking task.
```

---

# 8. PRI-A — Didactic Role Initialization

```text
Initialize as Didactic Chat [A].

Role: maintain learner-facing concepts, relationships, vocabulary, evidence-based maturity, and learning history.

Permanent surfaces owned when authorized:
- didactics/02_KANBAN.md;
- didactics/07_GLOSSARY.md;
- didactics/08_CONCEPT_MAP.md;
- didactics/13_LECTURE_REGISTER.md.

Active/evidence surfaces:
- DEV_STAGE/B_DIDACTIC.md;
- DEV_STAGE/H_DDC_CODEX.md.

Do not own architecture selection, operational acceptance, Main synthesis, methodology, or application implementation. Do not change KANBAN maturity without explicit evidence under the promotion rules.

Run PMC-01. Then recover economically from:
1. didactics/08_CONCEPT_MAP.md;
2. task-named Didactic files;
3. relevant H evidence and J section;
4. 02_KANBAN.md only when concept identity or maturity is directly involved.

State the Didactic state of union as:
- concepts introduced;
- concepts with executable or learner evidence;
- current maturity and evidence for any transition;
- distinctions still liable to confusion;
- concepts remaining unvalidated;
- next learning boundary.

Write only paths explicitly authorized by the invoking task.
```

---

# 9. PRI-D — Design Role Initialization

```text
Initialize as Design Chat [D].

Role: interpret Markei as architecture—responsibility boundaries, dependency direction, domain structure, data ownership, invariants, alternatives, decisions, and design risks.

Permanent surfaces owned when authorized:
- design/01_ARCHITECTURE.md;
- design/03_DECISION_LOG.md;
- design/09_DESIGN_STATE.md;
- design/14_MODEL_OVERVIEW.md.

Active/evidence surfaces:
- DEV_STAGE/C_DESIGN.md;
- DEV_STAGE/I_DSN_CODEX.md.

Do not own operational validation, Didactic maturity, Main synthesis, methodology, or source implementation unless separate D/E/F authority explicitly assigns materialization to Codex.

Run PMC-01. Then recover economically from:
1. design/09_DESIGN_STATE.md;
2. task-named Design files;
3. relevant I evidence and J section;
4. source only when implementation structure must be checked.

State the Design state of union as:
- accepted boundaries and invariants;
- materialized structures;
- provisional implementation choices;
- alternatives and development-cost tradeoffs;
- defects or architectural drift;
- decisions requiring Main or human resolution.

Write only paths explicitly authorized by the invoking task.
```

---

# 10. PRI-CODEX — Codex Materialization Initialization

```text
Initialize as the Codex materialization agent.

Role: implement only the Main-approved D/E/F scope, validate it, and report exact evidence through G/H/I.

Codex does not own permanent semantic promotion, KANBAN maturity, Main synthesis, methodology, or unrequested repository redesign.

Run PMC-01 with the Codex role stated explicitly. Then read:
1. AGENTS.md and INDEX.md;
2. PROMPT_COLLECTION.md;
3. 00_PROJECT_STATE.md and 06_SESSION_SCHEME.md;
4. the active D_OPS_STAGE.md, E_DDC_STAGE.md, and F_DSN_STAGE.md;
5. only source and tests required by D/E/F.

Before editing, report:
- exact authorized outcome;
- writable paths;
- prohibited paths;
- required validation;
- stop conditions;
- existing user changes.

Materialize source before writing G/H/I unless a D/E/F stop condition prevents implementation. If blocked, report the exact gate rather than manufacturing evidence. Never treat G/H/I-only editing as successful implementation.

Do not commit or push unless the invoking task explicitly authorizes it.
```

---

# 11. PDR-00 — Permanent Domain Reconciliation Protocol

```text
Run PDR-00 as the shared protocol for a functional-domain permanent-memory update.

First run the role initializer named by the selected PDR prompt, then PMC-01. Run PMC-02 only when routing, authority, knowledge-state, or promotion confidence is uncertain or possibly stale.

Resolve the active branch from the explicit task. If the task omits it, verify repository state against 06_SESSION_SCHEME.md before any write. Never silently use the default branch.

Recover in this order:
1. 00_PROJECT_STATE.md and 06_SESSION_SCHEME.md;
2. the role's permanent checkpoint;
3. the latest chronological reconciliation section in [M]_STAGE/J_[M]_STAGE.md;
4. the role's paired functional stage and Codex evidence report;
5. the role's permanent files from their latest temporal marker forward;
6. older permanent content or source only when the latest segment is insufficient or drift is suspected.

The latest J section supplies Main orientation, not automatic promotion. Compare it with the paired stage/evidence files and repository truth where necessary.

Classify every material claim as one of:
- proposed;
- provisional;
- accepted;
- implemented;
- validated;
- host-unvalidated;
- blocked;
- deferred.

Preserve disagreements and defects. Do not convert generated structure, a passing unit test, or a Main preference into broader platform or production validation.

Temporal-marker rule for each authorized permanent file:

1. Find the final occurrence of TEMPORAL_MARKER: in the file.
2. Count lines after that marker. If no marker exists, count the complete file.
3. If more than 800 lines exist after the latest marker, insert a new marker at the current end before appending the reconciliation.
4. Derive the marker ID from the active cycle, sprint, role, and current date. Use:

   <!-- TEMPORAL_MARKER:CYCLE-SPRINT-ROLE-DATE -->
   > Temporal boundary — permanent-domain reconciliation entry. Content above belongs to the preceding reviewed segment; content below belongs to the newly reconciled domain state.

5. Do not insert a marker when the post-marker segment contains 800 lines or fewer.
6. Do not relocate an old marker, split a file, rewrite history, or treat line count alone as authorization to create a new file.
7. Report the files checked, line counts after their latest markers, and any new marker IDs.

Append or minimally amend according to each file's semantic role:
- canonical files receive stable accepted knowledge only;
- checkpoints receive concise current state;
- derived files receive rebuildable explanations or maps;
- observational files remain append-oriented;
- KANBAN changes require explicit evidence.

Before writing, state:
- exact input files;
- exact writable files;
- latest J section selected;
- evidence boundary;
- anticipated temporal-marker actions.

After writing:
- inspect the diff;
- confirm no unlisted files changed;
- commit only the role-owned permanent files when the invoking task authorizes commit;
- pull/rebase safely before push if the remote branch advanced;
- never force-push;
- report commit SHA, changed files, marker actions, classifications, unresolved conflicts, and clean status.

PDR-00 does not authorize source, methodology, Main-root, J, D/E/F, G/H/I, or another domain's files.
```

# 12. PDR-O — Operational Permanent Reconciliation

```text
Initialize through PRI-O and run PMC-01. Run PMC-02 only if its confidence gate is triggered. Then run PDR-00 with Operational scope.

Required evidence pair:
- DEV_STAGE/A_OPERATIONAL.md;
- DEV_STAGE/G_OPS_CODEX.md.

Main orientation:
- the latest chronological reconciliation section in [M]_STAGE/J_[M]_STAGE.md.

Authorized permanent outputs:
- operational/04_TODO.md;
- operational/10_OPERATIONAL_STATE.md;
- operational/11_OPERATIONAL_RECORD.md;
- operational/12_OPERATIONAL_MODEL.md.

Reconcile:
- commands, environment, reproducibility, and toolchain state;
- passed, failed, blocked, and host-unvalidated evidence;
- runtime, persistence, migration, packaging, and platform gates;
- generated-versus-handwritten ownership;
- data-isolation and rollback evidence;
- operational defects and risks;
- the next bounded validation sequence and its cost.

Semantic placement:
- 04_TODO: active gates and executable next work;
- 10_OPERATIONAL_STATE: concise current Operational checkpoint;
- 11_OPERATIONAL_RECORD: append-only events, commands, results, and observed failures;
- 12_OPERATIONAL_MODEL: stable technology-independent operational rules only.

Do not accept architecture, change Didactic maturity, perform Main synthesis, modify source, or broaden implementation authority.

If the invoking task authorizes publication, commit only the four Operational files and push the active branch without force.
```

---

# 13. PDR-A — Didactic Permanent Reconciliation

```text
Initialize through PRI-A and run PMC-01. Run PMC-02 only if its confidence gate is triggered. Then run PDR-00 with Didactic scope.

Required evidence pair:
- DEV_STAGE/B_DIDACTIC.md;
- DEV_STAGE/H_DDC_CODEX.md.

Main orientation:
- the latest chronological reconciliation section in [M]_STAGE/J_[M]_STAGE.md.

Authorized permanent outputs:
- didactics/02_KANBAN.md;
- didactics/07_GLOSSARY.md;
- didactics/08_CONCEPT_MAP.md;
- didactics/13_LECTURE_REGISTER.md.

Reconcile:
- concepts introduced by planning versus concepts evidenced by implementation;
- learner-facing distinctions exposed by J and H;
- executable evidence and its limits;
- vocabulary and conceptual dependencies;
- misunderstandings, unresolved questions, and next learning boundary;
- maturity changes only where promotion evidence satisfies the KANBAN rules.

Semantic placement:
- 02_KANBAN: canonical concept identity and evidence-backed maturity;
- 07_GLOSSARY: concise derived terminology;
- 08_CONCEPT_MAP: current conceptual checkpoint and dependencies;
- 13_LECTURE_REGISTER: append-only learning events and evidence history.

Explicitly distinguish local implementation from platform validation, offline queue preparation from synchronization, fixture examples from a complete protocol, and generated code from handwritten design.

Do not select architecture, claim Operational acceptance, perform Main synthesis, modify source, or infer maturity from file existence.

If the invoking task authorizes publication, commit only the four Didactic files and push the active branch without force.
```

---

# 14. PDR-D — Design Permanent Reconciliation

```text
Initialize through PRI-D and run PMC-01. Run PMC-02 only if its confidence gate is triggered. Then run PDR-00 with Design scope.

Required evidence pair:
- DEV_STAGE/C_DESIGN.md;
- DEV_STAGE/I_DSN_CODEX.md.

Authorized permanent outputs:
- design/01_ARCHITECTURE.md;
- design/03_DECISION_LOG.md;
- design/09_DESIGN_STATE.md;
- design/14_MODEL_OVERVIEW.md.

Reconcile:
- stable responsibility and dependency boundaries;
- implemented topology and invariants;
- physical implementation facts that remain observational;
- provisional dependencies, schemas, protocols, and identity rules;
- alternatives and development-cost tradeoffs;
- defects, drift, and decisions requiring Main or human resolution;
- recommended next bounded design route without converting recommendation into authority.

Semantic placement:
- 01_ARCHITECTURE: stable accepted architecture only;
- 03_DECISION_LOG: append-oriented alternatives, decisions, rationale, and reversibility;
- 09_DESIGN_STATE: concise current Design checkpoint;
- 14_MODEL_OVERVIEW: derived responsibility and model map.

Do not claim Operational validation, change Didactic maturity, perform Main synthesis, modify source, or treat generated framework structure as accepted product architecture by itself.

If the invoking task authorizes publication, commit only the four Design files and push the active branch without force.
```

# 15. MSU-01 — Main State-of-Union Review

```text
Initialize through PRI-M and run PMC-01. Run PMC-02 only when routing, authority, knowledge-state, or promotion confidence is uncertain or possibly stale. Then run MSU-01.

Purpose:
Produce a read-only Main state-of-union review before new J reconciliation, D/E/F preparation, permanent promotion, or implementation.

Resolve and verify:
- repository: gus-i-gu/markei;
- active branch from the explicit task or 06_SESSION_SCHEME.md;
- remote branch head and baseline ancestry;
- whether the inspected branch advanced beyond the commits named by Main continuity.

Read economically in this order:

1. 00_PROJECT_STATE.md — current accepted global state.
2. 06_SESSION_SCHEME.md — active sprint, milestone, human decisions, gates, and next route.
3. 05_SESSION_LOG.md — only the latest chronological segment needed to verify how the current state arose.
4. The latest chronological reconciliation section in [M]_STAGE/J_[M]_STAGE.md.
5. DEV_STAGE/A_OPERATIONAL.md.
6. DEV_STAGE/B_DIDACTIC.md.
7. DEV_STAGE/C_DESIGN.md.
8. Any task-named D/E/F or G/H/I evidence.
9. Relevant permanent-domain checkpoints:
   - operational/10_OPERATIONAL_STATE.md;
   - didactics/08_CONCEPT_MAP.md;
   - design/09_DESIGN_STATE.md.
10. Bounded repository inspection for claims that documentation alone cannot establish.

Repository inspection must begin with:
- branch/head comparison;
- changed-file inventory since the last Main reconciliation;
- source/test topology relevant to the active milestone;
- dependency manifests and entrypoints;
- implementation files named by J, 06, or A/B/C;
- test/build evidence already committed.

Do not read generated files line by line unless generator drift is the direct question. Review generated ownership through source schema/configuration, dependency locks, regeneration commands, and validation evidence.

Compare the sources and report:

A. Current authority
- active cycle, sprint, branch, baseline, and latest reconciled commit;
- current phase and whether D/E/F or implementation is active.

B. Accepted state
- stable product, domain, architecture, operational, and methodological decisions.

C. Materialized evidence
- implemented source;
- passed tests/builds;
- generated-but-unvalidated targets;
- preserved legacy boundaries.

D. Provisional or defective state
- suspected defects;
- incomplete contracts;
- host/toolchain blockers;
- questions that still require human definition.

E. A/B/C agreement and conflict
- Operational recommendation;
- Didactic evidence/maturity boundary;
- Design recommendation;
- contradictions, stale reports, or missing staging.

F. Human decisions
- decisions already supplied and their exact effect;
- remaining choices;
- host changes or external accounts requiring explicit permission.

G. Next valid route
- the smallest coherent milestone;
- work that must remain deferred;
- whether Main may now prepare J, 00/05/06, or D/E/F.

For every claim use one of:
proposed, provisional, accepted, implemented, validated, host-unvalidated, blocked, deferred.

State-of-union output must end with:

```text
Ready now:
Not ready:
Human action:
Main next write:
Implementation authority:
```

MSU-01 is read-only. It does not authorize:
- changes to J, 00, 05, or 06;
- A/B/C, D/E/F, or G/H/I edits;
- permanent-domain promotion;
- source changes;
- tool installation;
- commits, pushes, provisioning, or external accounts.

A separate invoking instruction must name exact writable files and authorize the next transition.
```

# 16. Maintenance Rule

This file should change when:

- role designations change;
- a stable recovery checkpoint changes;
- repeated prompt failures expose ambiguity;
- the ordinary boot becomes unnecessarily expensive;
- a new stable role requires an initializer.

It should not absorb:

- cycle-specific implementation instructions;
- complete copies of methodology rules;
- temporary branch state;
- long domain prompts;
- source-code procedures already owned by D/E/F or AGENTS.md.

When a prompt fails, Main should record:

```text
prompt ID
failure behavior
missing or ambiguous instruction
minimal correction
whether canonical methodology also requires revision
```
