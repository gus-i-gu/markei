# 1. Purpose

`PROMOTION_RULES.md` defines how knowledge changes semantic state inside the Sketch Notebook Method.

It answers one primary question:

> What does this knowledge become?

It does not define:

* exact file paths;
* write authority;
* commit rules;
* boot order;
* staging filenames;
* Codex report filenames;
* domain checkpoint filenames.

Those operational rules belong to `FLUX.md`.

`METHOD_FOUNDATIONS.md` defines the ontology of the method.

`FLUX.md` defines routing and authority.

`CHAT_PROTOCOL.md` defines communication structure.

`PROMOTION_RULES.md` defines semantic transformation.

---

# 2. Promotion

Promotion is the controlled transformation of knowledge from one maturity state into another.

Promotion is not merely copying text between files.

Promotion changes the epistemic status of information.

A piece of knowledge may become:

```text
captured
staged
classified
validated
synthesized
canonical
derived
checkpointed
observational
materialized
reconciled
```

Promotion gives structure to the movement from transient conversation toward durable project memory, implementation, or historical record.

---

# 3. Promotion vs Materialization

Promotion and materialization are different operations.

## 3.1 Promotion

Promotion is semantic.

It determines:

* what the knowledge means;
* how mature the knowledge is;
* which domain owns it;
* whether it is canonical, derived, checkpoint, observational, or staged;
* whether it should affect implementation or memory.

Promotion happens through reasoning, classification, validation, synthesis, and reconciliation.

## 3.2 Materialization

Materialization is physical.

It changes files.

Materialization may affect:

* source code;
* notebook files;
* stage files;
* domain folders;
* methodology files;
* repository structure.

Materialization is performed by Codex, explicit human editing, or other authorized file-editing processes.

## 3.3 Relationship

Promotion decides what a change means.

Materialization applies a change to files.

A materialized change is not automatically semantically valid.

A promoted conclusion is not persistent until it is materialized or otherwise recorded in the appropriate notebook memory.

---

# 4. Knowledge States

The Sketch Notebook Method recognizes several knowledge states.

These states are semantic.

Exact paths and writable locations are defined by `FLUX.md`.

---

## 4.1 Transient Conversation

Transient Conversation is raw dialogue.

It may include:

* ideas;
* doubts;
* questions;
* explanations;
* hypotheses;
* plans;
* arguments;
* exploratory reasoning.

This state is temporary.

Nothing in conversation is persistent project memory until captured, staged, materialized, or recorded.

---

## 4.2 Captured Knowledge

Captured Knowledge is information identified as potentially relevant.

Capture exists to prevent useful reasoning from disappearing inside chat history.

Capture does not imply approval.

Capture only means:

> This may matter later.

Captured knowledge may be incomplete, uncertain, contradictory, or exploratory.

---

## 4.3 Classified Knowledge

Classified Knowledge has been assigned a semantic domain or role.

Classification answers:

> What kind of knowledge is this?

Common classifications include:

* operational action;
* operational observation;
* operational model candidate;
* didactic concept;
* glossary candidate;
* learning observation;
* design observation;
* architectural decision candidate;
* derived summary candidate;
* checkpoint update;
* methodology refinement;
* implementation instruction;
* historical event;
* structural gap;
* drift report.

Classification does not make knowledge canonical.

It only identifies what kind of handling it requires.

---

## 4.4 Functional Stage

Functional Stage is domain-specific staging performed by functional chats.

Functional staging captures current reasoning from:

* Operational Chat;
* Didactic Chat;
* Design Chat.

Functional stage material is not canonical.

It is working material awaiting Main synthesis, domain-memory update, or later reconciliation.

---

## 4.5 Main Synthesis

Main Synthesis is the integration of staged material by Main Chat.

Main synthesis may:

* compare functional reports;
* resolve contradictions;
* detect drift;
* choose implementation direction;
* prepare materialization instructions;
* determine notebook update requirements;
* defer unresolved questions.

Main synthesis transforms multiple domain perspectives into coherent project direction.

---

## 4.6 Materialization Stage

Materialization Stage is Main-approved instruction before physical change.

It may include:

* patch instructions;
* application implementation plans;
* notebook update proposals;
* command sequences;
* validation instructions;
* domain-memory update instructions;
* methodology update instructions.

Materialization stage material is not final memory.

It is the instruction layer before physical materialization.

---

## 4.7 Codex Report Stage

Codex Report Stage is post-materialization evidence.

It records what Codex actually did.

It may include:

* files changed;
* files created;
* files deleted;
* commands run;
* validation results;
* skipped instructions;
* failed instructions;
* unresolved risks;
* suggested follow-up.

Codex report material is observational evidence.

It is not canonical knowledge.

It becomes useful when functional chats classify it, domain files absorb it, and Main Chat reconciles it.

---

## 4.8 Canonical Knowledge

Canonical Knowledge defines accepted truth within a domain.

Canonical knowledge should be:

* validated;
* stable enough to depend on;
* owned by one domain;
* free from unresolved contradiction;
* revisable only through deliberate update.

Examples include:

* methodology principles;
* didactic KANBAN concepts;
* architecture rules;
* accepted design decisions;
* operational models;
* domain models;
* stable responsibility boundaries.

Canonical knowledge belongs in permanent domain memory.

---

## 4.9 Derived Knowledge

Derived Knowledge reorganizes, summarizes, indexes, maps, or explains canonical knowledge.

Derived knowledge does not create independent truth.

It depends on canonical knowledge.

Examples include:

* glossary entries;
* model overviews;
* concept maps;
* TODO views;
* project-state summaries;
* navigation summaries.

If derived knowledge contradicts canonical knowledge, the derived knowledge is stale or invalid unless the canonical file is also being revised through an authorized process.

---

## 4.10 Domain Checkpoint

A Domain Checkpoint is ephemeral derived knowledge optimized for recovery.

It summarizes the current state of a domain so a role can recover context without reading all canonical, derived, observational, or repository material.

A checkpoint should answer:

* where the domain currently stands;
* what is stable;
* what is active;
* what is unresolved;
* what recently changed;
* what should be read next if deeper context is required.

A checkpoint does not introduce independent truth.

A checkpoint should be refreshed when domain state changes.

A checkpoint may become stale.

A stale checkpoint should be regenerated from canonical, derived, observational, and implementation evidence.

---

## 4.11 Observational Record

An Observational Record preserves what happened.

It records:

* actions;
* sessions;
* lectures;
* decisions;
* validation attempts;
* failures;
* materialization events;
* human overrides;
* drift observations;
* reconciliation events.

Observational records do not define current truth by themselves.

They preserve sequence and evidence.

They should generally be append-oriented.

---

## 4.12 Reconciled Knowledge

Reconciled Knowledge has been checked against other relevant project-memory layers.

Reconciliation may compare:

* checkpoint state;
* canonical domain knowledge;
* derived domain knowledge;
* observational history;
* stage files;
* Codex reports;
* source code;
* human direction.

Reconciled knowledge may produce:

* canonical correction;
* derived regeneration;
* checkpoint refresh;
* observational note;
* new TODO;
* design revision;
* didactic update;
* operational update;
* methodology refinement.

Reconciliation does not always promote knowledge.

Sometimes it confirms that no change is needed.

Sometimes it detects drift.

---

# 5. Conceptual Promotion Lifecycle

The general lifecycle is:

```text
Transient Conversation
↓
Capture
↓
Classification
↓
Functional Stage
↓
Main Synthesis
↓
Materialization Stage
↓
Materialization
↓
Codex Report Stage
↓
Domain Classification
↓
Canonical / Derived / Checkpoint / Observational Memory
↓
Reconciliation
↓
Persistence
```

This lifecycle may be shortened for small tasks.

It should not be bypassed when knowledge affects:

* methodology;
* project architecture;
* learning state;
* implementation behavior;
* domain memory;
* file structure;
* source code;
* durable project direction.

---

# 6. Domain Symmetry and Promotion

Every functional domain should expose four semantic roles:

```text
Canonical Knowledge
Derived Knowledge
Domain Checkpoint
Observational History
```

Promotion must respect these roles.

The same event may produce updates in more than one role.

Example:

```text
A new architectural decision is accepted.
↓
Canonical: architecture file updated.
Observational: decision log entry appended.
Derived: model overview refreshed.
Checkpoint: design state refreshed.
```

A single file should not permanently carry incompatible semantic roles if doing so creates drift.

Canonical files should be able to improve definitions.

Observational files should preserve historical sequence.

Derived files should summarize truth without creating it.

Checkpoints should remain compact and recoverable.

---

# 7. Hierarchical Recovery and Promotion

The Hierarchical Recovery Principle affects how promotion is validated.

Before promoting new knowledge, the system should prefer the least expensive sufficient source.

The recovery order is:

```text
Domain Checkpoint
↓
Canonical Knowledge
↓
Derived Knowledge
↓
Observational History
↓
Repository Inspection
```

This order is not a proof hierarchy.

It is a recovery-cost hierarchy.

For promotion decisions:

* a checkpoint may identify the current state;
* canonical knowledge determines stable truth;
* derived knowledge explains or summarizes canonical truth;
* observational history explains how the current state emerged;
* repository inspection verifies implementation reality when needed.

A checkpoint alone should not be treated as canonical evidence.

A derived summary alone should not override canonical knowledge.

An observational record alone should not define current truth.

Repository inspection may override notebook assumptions when implementation truth contradicts project memory, but that contradiction should be recorded as drift and reconciled.

---

# 8. Capture

Capture is the transition from transient conversation into potentially useful memory.

Capture may occur when:

* a user proposes a new direction;
* a bug exposes a concept;
* a design question appears;
* a command fails;
* a new relationship is discovered;
* Codex reports a materialization result;
* a chat identifies drift;
* a recurring term needs definition.

Captured knowledge should be preserved in the appropriate stage, report, log, or domain file according to `FLUX.md`.

Capture does not validate.

Capture does not promote to canon.

Capture only prevents loss.

---

# 9. Classification

Classification determines what kind of knowledge has been captured.

Classification asks:

```text
Which domain owns this?
Which semantic role does it serve?
How mature is it?
What should happen next?
```

Classification dimensions include:

## 9.1 Domain Classification

Possible domain classifications include:

```text
operational
didactic
design
methodological
main/global
implementation/source
```

## 9.2 Semantic Role Classification

Possible semantic-role classifications include:

```text
canonical
derived
checkpoint
observational
stage
materialization instruction
Codex report evidence
structural gap
drift
```

## 9.3 Maturity Classification

Possible maturity classifications include:

```text
raw
captured
staged
validated
accepted
deferred
rejected
superseded
stale
reconciled
```

Classification is required before durable promotion.

---

# 10. Validation

Validation determines whether knowledge is stable enough to move forward.

Before promotion, the system should ask:

1. Is the information clear?
2. Is it useful?
3. Is it sufficiently supported by evidence or reasoning?
4. Does it belong to this domain?
5. Does another canonical source already own this knowledge?
6. Is it consistent with current checkpoints?
7. Is it consistent with canonical files?
8. Is it consistent with derived files?
9. Is it consistent with observational evidence?
10. Is repository inspection required?
11. Is it ready to affect permanent memory or implementation?

Unvalidated knowledge should remain staged, remain observational, be marked as unresolved, or be discarded.

---

# 11. Synthesis

Synthesis combines classified and validated material into coherent direction.

Synthesis is mainly performed by Main Chat.

Synthesis may:

* merge functional reports;
* resolve contradictions;
* identify drift;
* choose an implementation direction;
* prepare Codex instructions;
* determine domain-memory updates;
* determine checkpoint refresh needs;
* decide that more investigation is required.

Synthesis is the bridge between functional reasoning and materialization.

Synthesis does not automatically make knowledge canonical.

Canonical promotion still requires domain-appropriate validation and placement.

---

# 12. Canonical Promotion

Canonical Promotion occurs when knowledge becomes accepted truth within a domain.

Examples:

* a recurring concept becomes a KANBAN entry;
* a stable architecture rule enters architecture documentation;
* an operational convention becomes part of the operational model;
* a methodology principle becomes part of methodology specification;
* a domain relationship becomes an accepted design decision.

Canonical promotion should be careful and deliberate.

A canonical document should not receive raw, uncertain, or contradictory material.

Canonical promotion should identify:

* the domain owner;
* the canonical home;
* supporting evidence;
* affected derived files;
* affected checkpoints;
* relevant observational records;
* whether repository verification is required.

Canonical knowledge may be revised.

Revision should preserve historical explanation through observational records when the change is significant.

---

# 13. Derived Generation

Derived Generation occurs when canonical knowledge is reorganized into a useful view.

Derived generation may produce or refresh:

* glossary entries;
* model overviews;
* concept maps;
* TODO views;
* project state summaries;
* architecture summaries;
* navigation summaries.

Derived documents are useful views.

They are not independent sources of truth.

Derived generation should occur when:

* canonical knowledge changes;
* derived material becomes stale;
* Main reconciliation detects drift;
* a checkpoint needs compact support material;
* a domain requires easier recovery or explanation.

If derived material conflicts with canonical material, the derived material should be corrected or regenerated.

---

# 14. Checkpoint Refresh

Checkpoint Refresh occurs when a domain checkpoint is updated to reflect the current state of a domain.

Checkpoint refresh is a form of derived generation.

It is optimized for low-token recovery.

Checkpoint refresh may summarize:

* stable canonical state;
* active work;
* recent changes;
* unresolved issues;
* drift;
* next files to inspect;
* next likely actions or concepts.

A checkpoint should not become:

* a canonical register;
* a long historical log;
* a replacement for domain files;
* a place for independent truth.

Checkpoint refresh should happen after:

* Codex report classification;
* domain-memory updates;
* canonical promotion;
* derived regeneration;
* important observational recording;
* Main reconciliation;
* meaningful implementation changes.

A checkpoint may remain empty or minimal when the domain itself has not yet been initialized.

---

# 15. Observational Recording

Observational Recording preserves what happened.

It should record events, not redefine truth.

Examples include:

* session summaries;
* execution attempts;
* test results;
* materialization events;
* decisions accepted or postponed;
* concepts introduced;
* misconceptions detected;
* Codex reports;
* promotions performed;
* reconciliation events.

Observational records should generally be append-oriented.

Observational records may later support canonical promotion, but they do not become canonical merely because they are recorded.

---

# 16. Codex Report Absorption

Codex Report Absorption is the process of interpreting G/H/I report evidence after materialization.

Codex reports should be treated as observational evidence.

Functional chats should classify Codex report content into domain roles:

```text
canonical update candidate
derived update candidate
checkpoint refresh
observational record
structural gap
drift
future TODO
```

Codex reports should not be copied blindly into permanent memory.

They should be interpreted by the appropriate functional chat.

Main Chat then reconciles domain updates with global project state.

---

# 17. Drift Detection

Drift occurs when two or more project-memory layers disagree.

Examples:

* checkpoint contradicts canonical file;
* derived file omits new canonical knowledge;
* observational history says something changed but checkpoint does not reflect it;
* repository implementation differs from notebook memory;
* Codex report says an instruction failed but stage files imply success;
* human direction supersedes notebook state;
* old filenames remain referenced after methodological rename.

Drift is not automatically failure.

Drift is a signal that reconciliation is required.

Drift should be classified as:

```text
checkpoint drift
derived drift
canonical drift
observational gap
implementation drift
routing drift
methodology drift
naming drift
```

---

# 18. Reconciliation

Reconciliation compares project-memory layers and resolves or records drift.

Reconciliation asks:

1. Does the checkpoint reflect the canonical state?
2. Does derived knowledge reflect canonical knowledge?
3. Does observational history explain how the current state emerged?
4. Does repository state agree with notebook memory?
5. Did materialization match Main-approved instructions?
6. Did human direction override prior knowledge?
7. Are filenames and routes still canonical?
8. Are domain roles still distinguishable?

Reconciliation may result in:

* no change;
* checkpoint refresh;
* derived regeneration;
* canonical correction;
* observational note;
* new TODO;
* design revision;
* didactic update;
* operational update;
* methodology refinement;
* source-code correction;
* stage-file correction.

Reconciliation should preserve history when correcting current truth.

---

# 19. Promotion Directions

Promotion may occur in several directions.

## 19.1 Vertical Promotion

Vertical Promotion changes maturity.

Example:

```text
Raw observation
↓
Captured note
↓
Functional stage
↓
Validated conclusion
↓
Canonical knowledge
↓
Derived summary
↓
Checkpoint refresh
```

Vertical promotion answers:

> How mature is this knowledge?

## 19.2 Horizontal Promotion

Horizontal Promotion changes domain ownership or perspective.

Example:

```text
Operational bug discovery
→ Design architecture review
```

or:

```text
Design relationship decision
→ Didactic KANBAN candidate
```

Horizontal promotion answers:

> Which domain should own or interpret this knowledge?

## 19.3 Reflective Promotion

Reflective Promotion updates the methodology itself.

Example:

```text
Repeated file drift
↓
Methodological observation
↓
Main synthesis
↓
FLUX update
```

Reflective promotion answers:

> Does the method itself need to change?

Reflective promotion should be rare and human-supervised.

---

# 20. Domain-Specific Promotion

## 20.1 Operational Promotion

Operational promotion may transform:

* failed command → operational record;
* repeated validation procedure → operational model;
* current blocker → operational state;
* deferred action → TODO;
* Codex implementation evidence → operational record or state update.

Operational canonical promotion belongs to stable operational knowledge.

Operational observation belongs to operational history.

Operational state belongs to the operational checkpoint.

## 20.2 Didactic Promotion

Didactic promotion may transform:

* implementation problem → concept candidate;
* recurring concept → KANBAN entry;
* concept definition → glossary entry;
* current learning dependency → concept map;
* lecture event → lecture register;
* misconception → learning observation.

Didactic canonical promotion should preserve KANBAN numbering and concept identity.

Didactic derived generation should not create new concept truth.

## 20.3 Design Promotion

Design promotion may transform:

* design observation → decision candidate;
* accepted responsibility boundary → architecture;
* postponed decision → decision log;
* model summary → model overview;
* current architecture state → design checkpoint;
* implementation contradiction → design drift.

Design canonical promotion belongs in architecture or other accepted design canonical files.

Design observational recording belongs in decision history.

Design checkpoint refresh belongs in design state.

## 20.4 Methodological Promotion

Methodological promotion may transform:

* repeated workflow failure → method issue;
* recurring vocabulary ambiguity → method glossary entry;
* routing ambiguity → FLUX update;
* concept-state ambiguity → PROMOTION_RULES update;
* communication inconsistency → CHAT_PROTOCOL update;
* foundational ambiguity → METHOD_FOUNDATIONS update.

Methodological promotion must be deliberate.

It should be supervised by Main Chat and the human developer.

---

# 21. Structural Gaps

A Structural Gap exists when the method requires a semantic role but the repository does not yet provide an adequate file, route, or protocol.

Examples:

* a domain lacks observational history;
* a domain checkpoint exists but is empty or structurally unusable;
* a canonical file is missing for a required domain role;
* a methodology term is used but not defined;
* a file rename occurred but old references remain;
* a functional chat is responsible for a duty but has no protocol.

Structural gaps should not be silently patched by arbitrary file creation.

They should be reported, synthesized, and materialized through the authority defined by `FLUX.md`.

---

# 22. Promotion Integrity Rules

## Rule 1 — Conversation is not persistence

A fact, idea, decision, or concept is not part of project memory until captured, staged, recorded, or materialized.

## Rule 2 — Staging is not canon

Stage material may be useful, but it is not authoritative.

## Rule 3 — Codex reports are evidence, not canon

G/H/I reports describe materialization evidence.

They must be interpreted before becoming domain memory.

## Rule 4 — Canonical ownership must be unique

Each stable knowledge object should have one canonical home.

Duplicate canonical truth creates drift.

## Rule 5 — Derived knowledge cannot create truth

Derived documents summarize, reorganize, map, or explain.

They do not establish independent facts.

## Rule 6 — Checkpoints cannot create truth

Domain checkpoints summarize current domain state for recovery.

They do not override canonical files.

## Rule 7 — Observational records do not define current truth

Historical records preserve sequence and evidence.

They do not determine current project state by themselves.

## Rule 8 — Materialization requires synthesis

Permanent repository changes should follow Main synthesis or explicit human instruction.

## Rule 9 — Methodology changes require methodological context

Changes to methodology specifications should happen only during explicit methodological work.

## Rule 10 — File creation and renaming require routing authority

New files and file renames must follow `FLUX.md`.

Semantic need alone does not authorize arbitrary file creation.

## Rule 11 — Reconciliation preserves history

Correcting current truth should not erase useful historical evidence.

---

# 23. Relationship with METHOD_FOUNDATIONS

`METHOD_FOUNDATIONS.md` defines what the Sketch Notebook Method is.

It defines foundational ontology, including:

* project memory;
* knowledge domains;
* Domain Symmetry;
* Domain Checkpoints;
* Hierarchical Recovery;
* Continuous Reconciliation.

`PROMOTION_RULES.md` depends on that ontology.

It should not redefine the method’s foundation.

It defines how knowledge moves through the ontology.

---

# 24. Relationship with FLUX

`PROMOTION_RULES.md` defines semantic transformation.

`FLUX.md` defines operational routing.

This document intentionally avoids exact file paths, writable paths, commit scopes, and concrete authority rules except when referring to conceptual roles.

If a question asks:

> What does this knowledge become?

consult `PROMOTION_RULES.md`.

If a question asks:

> Which file may write where?

consult `FLUX.md`.

If promotion requires materialization, `FLUX.md` determines who may perform it.

---

# 25. Relationship with CHAT_PROTOCOL

`CHAT_PROTOCOL.md` defines communication structure.

Promotion may require structured reporting.

Examples:

* Didactic concepts require a defined concept format.
* Checkpoints may require compact recovery structure.
* Observational records may require readable append-oriented entries.

`PROMOTION_RULES.md` determines the semantic state.

`CHAT_PROTOCOL.md` determines the communication form.

---

# 26. Closing Principle

Promotion is the discipline that prevents conversation from becoming chaos.

It allows knowledge to move through capture, classification, validation, synthesis, materialization, checkpointing, observation, and reconciliation.

It protects the project from confusing:

* raw thought with stable truth;
* stage files with canonical memory;
* Codex reports with interpretation;
* derived summaries with authority;
* checkpoints with canon;
* historical records with current state;
* materialized files with validated knowledge.

The Sketch Notebook does not merely store information.

It changes the status of information deliberately.
