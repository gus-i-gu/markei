## Current architecture

Sprint 05 established an Android-local debug slice without changing the accepted shared-client direction:

```text
Windows / Android Flutter hosts
→ shared entrypoint and asynchronous composition
→ presentation
→ application commands/query ports
→ independent Dart domain
→ local repository adapters
→ Drift schema v2 / application-private SQLite
```

Android/Kotlin remains a host. It owns no Product, Purchase, Event, sequence, analytics, or repository behavior. Cycle 06 Python/PySide6 and its database remain protected and recoverable.

## Implemented and validated

- Android namespace/application ID: `com.gusigu.markei`; label: `Markei`;
- Flutter embedding v2 and minimal `FlutterActivity` host;
- asynchronous composition loads Device identity before event-producing commands;
- database-owned UUID v4 replaces production `windows-device` injection;
- UUID persists across reopen; fresh databases differ;
- sequence continues 1→2 for the persisted Device;
- historical non-UUID Device rows are preserved and not reused;
- no schema migration was needed because Drift v2 already owns Device and sequence fields;
- `SafeArea` and staged BRL total extend the functional scaffold;
- 27 Flutter tests and analysis passed;
- debug APK built; identity badging passed;
- API 36 emulator boot/install/launch passed;
- Android app-private database and Device/Purchase facts were observed;
- human Android Purchase registration was confirmed;
- Windows build and five Python regressions passed.

## Accepted Design boundaries

- stable application ID owns Android installation/update and sandbox continuity;
- application label is presentation metadata, not identity;
- Account remains the provisional `local-account` placeholder;
- Device is an app-private UUID v4 with sequence attached to its database row;
- Device is not hardware-, platform-, Account-, email-, or application-ID-derived;
- Product, Purchase, Item, Event, and catalogue identity rules remain unchanged;
- compile/target SDK 36 and host tool versions are Operational configuration, not domain architecture;
- SafeArea and staged total are bounded scaffold choices, not final UI acceptance;
- local queue/event preparation is not synchronization.

## Prototype-only debt

`LocalDeviceIdentityRepository` scans only the first 20 Account Devices by creation time and selects the earliest UUID v4. This is acceptable for the bounded single-installation prototype only.

Before real synchronization or multiple-Device history, Design requires an explicit current-installation relation with exactly one referenced Device, idempotent concurrent bootstrap, uniqueness protection, and preserved historical Devices. Exact physical schema and migration remain open.

## Evidence limits

```text
validated
    debug Android build and one emulator execution
    sandbox persistence observation
    Device bootstrap/reopen/sequence tests
    human Purchase registration
    Windows/Python regression

partial or host-unvalidated
    keyboard and Back behavior
    rotation and background/resume
    larger text and accessibility
    complete force-stop/cold-relaunch matrix
    physical device compatibility

not accepted/deferred
    final UI/UX
    production signing/release/store
    backup policy
    authentication/API/Neon/synchronization
    central catalogue/import/iOS/PySide6 retirement
```

Automated ADB form entry was blocked by emulator input overlays, while manual registration passed. Phone-width widget tests do not establish final visual quality or complete Android lifecycle behavior.

## Next valid route

Main may close Sprint 05 if current debug-development evidence is sufficient, or authorize one bounded supplemental Android checklist for keyboard, Back, rotation, background/resume, larger text, and cold relaunch. Broad UI/UX formalization must remain a later sprint. The explicit installation-Device invariant must be resolved before real synchronization.

Additional implementation remains inactive until Main/human authority is expressed through fresh D/E/F.
