# 1. Domain Entities

## Product

Product is the permanent inventory record.

Owns:

- product identity;
- editable product metadata;
- current inventory state;
- accepted cached product-level summaries.

Relevant summaries:

- `average_duration_days`;
- `expected_next_purchase`;
- `average_shelf_life_days`;
- `expected_expiration_date`.

Product must not own individual purchase history rows, History aggregate rows, Lists display rows, Settings semantics, operational-date rules, History analytics rows, or desktop packaging state.

## Purchase

Purchase is the immutable receipt/batch history record.

Owns:

- factual purchase date;
- quantity and unit;
- unit price and total price;
- promotion flag;
- product relationship;
- store relationship;
- optional `expiration_date`;
- notes.

Current purchase records store date values without reliable time-of-day. Operational date remains a derived service interpretation rather than a replacement persisted fact.

## Store

Store is the identity/location record.

Owns:

- store ID;
- name;
- city;
- state;
- nullable address.

Store create/update editing belongs in Settings rather than RegisterPage.

---

# 2. Settings Model

Settings is application configuration, not product or purchase data.

Current persistence shape:

```text
settings(key, value)
```

Canonical Cycle 04 settings:

| Key | Semantic value | Owner of interpretation | Current effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `history.week_boundary` | lowercase weekday | ProductService | weekly History bucket start |
| `history.month_boundary_mode` | `first_weekday` or `day_of_month` | ProductService | operational month strategy |
| `history.month_boundary_weekday` | lowercase weekday | ProductService | weekday used by `first_weekday` mode |
| `history.month_boundary_day` | string/integer 1–28 | ProductService | day used by `day_of_month` mode |
| `time_reference.day_boundary_time` | normalized `HH:MM` | ProductService | operational-date derivation helper |
| `pages.order` | persisted page-order text | none in active UI | inert; MainWindow does not consume it |

Ownership:

- SQLite stores setting rows.
- Repository reads/writes generic key/value values.
- ProductService defines defaults, validates submitted values, normalizes persisted values, and interprets behavior.
- SettingsPage presents controls, separates labels from semantic item values, collects edits, and triggers save.

Validation distinction:

```text
invalid user edit
    -> strict rejection before persistence

invalid persisted value
    -> tolerant fallback to service default
```

Compatibility:

- `history.month_boundary_rule` is legacy compatibility residue.
- ProductService may map old `first_<weekday>` values only when canonical month keys are absent.
- The legacy key is not current canonical design.

---

# 3. Derived Product View Model

Product View is a service-prepared read model rendered by `ProductDetailPanel`.

Derived data includes:

- product identity;
- average price;
- average shelf-life;
- expected expiration;
- latest store-price rows;
- recent purchase rows.

Average price remains derived from Purchase rows.

---

# 4. Derived Lists View Model

Lists View is a service-prepared read model rendered by `ListsPage`.

Internal meanings:

```text
in-house  -> former Storage meaning
shortage  -> former Shortage meaning
to-buy    -> former Market meaning
```

Supported views:

- all-products hybrid view;
- `in-house`;
- `shortage`;
- `to-buy`;
- `in-house + shortage`;
- `shortage + to-buy`.

Derived row data includes identity, brand, quantity, latest price, delta price, product cycle, expected next purchase, remaining days, status, and display labels.

Ownership:

- ProductService owns status, latest/delta meaning, remaining-days interpretation, and row assembly.
- ListsPage owns view selection and rendering.
- Repository retrieves supporting rows.

Cycle 04 invariant:

- ListsPage does not read or interpret `time_reference.day_boundary_time`.
- Lists status remains purchase-rhythm based.
- Operational-day semantics do not yet change Lists classification or prediction behavior.

---

# 5. Derived History View Model

History View is a service-prepared read model rendered by HistoryPage.

Derived grouped data includes:

- operational month sections;
- week sections;
- ordered purchase rows;
- period labels and boundaries;
- summaries and total rows;
- diagnostics for unparsed rows.

Current grouping inputs:

```text
history.week_boundary
history.month_boundary_mode
history.month_boundary_weekday
history.month_boundary_day
```

Grouping ownership:

- ProductService reads normalized settings and constructs month/week buckets.
- HistoryPage renders prepared sections and does not calculate period membership.
- Repository retrieves raw purchase/store/settings rows.

Month modes:

```text
first_weekday
    first configured weekday of each calendar month

day_of_month
    configured day 1-28 of each calendar month
```

The displayed end of a period should be the day before the next period begins. The current first-weekday period-end implementation requires operational verification.

---

# 6. Derived History Analytics View Model

History Analytics is a service-prepared read model rendered by an embedded read-only History component.

Analytics frame:

```text
date range + optional store filter
```

Derived summary data includes parsed/unparsed/excluded counts, total spent, and frame average purchase timelapse.

Derived product rows include product totals, expenditure percentages, purchase count, product cycle, frame average, cycle difference, comparison label, and insufficient-data reason.

Ownership:

- ProductService owns frame interpretation and analytics calculations.
- HistoryPage owns controls and rendering.
- Repository retrieves supporting rows.
- SQLite does not persist analytics cache fields.

---

# 7. Temporal Model

Markei distinguishes factual time, operational interpretation, product rhythms, History grouping, and analytics frames.

```text
Factual purchase date
    stored on Purchase

Operational date
    derived by ProductService from date/datetime + day-boundary time

Purchase rhythm
    average_duration_days
    expected_next_purchase

Shelf-life rhythm
    average_shelf_life_days
    expected_expiration_date

History grouping
    history.week_boundary
    history.month_boundary_mode
    history.month_boundary_weekday
    history.month_boundary_day

Operational-day reference
    time_reference.day_boundary_time

Analytics frame timelapse
    average interval between parsed purchases in selected date/store frame
```

Invariants:

- Factual purchase date and operational date are different semantic values.
- Operational date is derived, not persisted as a replacement fact.
- A datetime before the configured boundary maps to the previous operational date.
- A date-only value remains that date because no time-of-day evidence exists.
- The Cycle 04 setting is contract-ready but does not materially shift existing date-only History rows.
- Purchase rhythm answers expected rebuy timing.
- Shelf-life rhythm answers expected batch expiration.
- History grouping answers reporting bucket membership.
- Analytics frame timelapse answers purchase density inside a selected frame.
- Lists classification remains purchase-rhythm based.

# 8. UI Model Boundary

## ProductDetailPanel

Receives prepared data and renders it. It does not query repositories or calculate domain meaning.

## RegisterPage

Owns receipt entry and ProductDetailPanel composition. It does not own store management.

## ListsPage

Owns view controls, rendering, refresh, and product-opening events. It does not calculate status, prices, remaining days, or operational-date behavior.

## HistoryPage

Owns rendering, date/store analytics controls, and refresh. It does not group raw purchases, interpret History settings, or calculate analytics.

## SettingsPage

Owns:

- configuration controls;
- desktop labels;
- semantic combo item values;
- edit state;
- save events;
- validation feedback presentation;
- store create/update UI.

It must not:

- calculate History grouping;
- interpret the operational-day boundary;
- mutate HistoryPage directly;
- bypass ProductService/Repository;
- activate page ordering through MainWindow.

## MainWindow

Owns static public tab mounting and refresh orchestration. Current public tabs remain Register, Lists, History, and Settings. `pages.order` remains inert.

---

# 9. Persistence and Migration Overview

- Canonical defaults are added through non-destructive default insertion.
- Existing values are preserved.
- Legacy month-boundary values may remain stored but are compatibility input rather than canonical state.
- Migration/removal of legacy keys requires a later explicit decision.
- Production initialization uses `schema.sql` without `seed.sql`.
- Fresh production initialization creates six Settings rows while product, purchase, store, and category tables remain empty.
- The writable desktop database is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Markei\market.sqlite`.
- SQLite WAL/SHM files, when present, belong beside the writable database rather than in the installation directory.

---

# 10. Mobile Readiness Overview

Cycle 04 improves portability through:

- service-owned Settings defaults and validation;
- semantic stored values separate from desktop labels;
- ProductService-owned period interpretation;
- a platform-neutral operational-date helper;
- unchanged generic Repository persistence.

Cycle 05 Sprint 01 adds desktop delivery while preserving platform isolation:

- packaging and installer files remain desktop infrastructure;
- ProductService and Repository contracts remain free of installer concerns;
- SQLite remains the current desktop persistence implementation rather than a future mobile contract;
- the Sprint 02 clone may omit Windows packaging without changing business meaning.

Still not ready:

- mobile presentation implementation;
- platform selection;
- server/shared backend;
- authentication or synchronization;
- mobile persistence;
- typed service contracts;
- dependency injection/service factory;
- time-of-day capture strategy;
- comprehensive automated testing;
- desktop/mobile data migration and coexistence design.

Mobile readiness remains preparation through boundaries, not authorization for a mobile rewrite.

# 11. Desktop Delivery and Runtime Context

Accepted Cycle 05 Sprint 01 delivery chain:

```text
Markei source application
    ↓
PyInstaller one-folder runtime
    ↓
Inno Setup per-user installer configuration
    ↓
installed Windows application
```

The frozen runtime is a generated delivery artifact. The Inno Setup script is installer source configuration. A configured installer is not equivalent to a compiled or validated installed release.

## 11.1 Runtime Artifact Model

```text
PyInstaller
    ↓ freezes
Markei.exe
Python runtime
PySide6 / Qt dependencies
Qt platform plugins
schema.sql
```

PyInstaller owns:

- runtime freezing;
- dependency and Qt collection;
- read-only schema resource bundling;
- executable metadata.

The validated production runtime contains `schema.sql` and excludes:

```text
seed.sql
market.sqlite
market.sqlite-wal
market.sqlite-shm
sample business records
```

## 11.2 Installation Model

```text
Inno Setup configuration
    ↓ places and registers
installed one-folder runtime
Start Menu shortcut
optional desktop shortcut
uninstall entry
stable upgrade identity
```

Inno Setup owns installation placement and Windows shell lifecycle metadata. It does not execute SQL, initialize the database, interpret migrations, or own business records.

The installer source configuration is accepted, but compilation and installed lifecycle remain unvalidated because `ISCC.exe` was unavailable.

## 11.3 Persistent-State Model

```text
installed application files
    separate from
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Markei
    ├── market.sqlite
    ├── SQLite sidecars when active
    └── logs
```

Database lifecycle owns:

- bundled-resource discovery;
- creation of the writable user-data directory;
- schema-only database initialization;
- settings defaults;
- migrations;
- preservation of existing user data.

External user-data placement supports preservation, but upgrade, uninstall, and reinstall preservation require direct validation against a compiled installer.

## 11.4 Startup and Failure Model

```text
root main.py
    ↓
app.main
    ↓
QApplication + MainWindow
```

Startup infrastructure may present fatal initialization errors and write diagnostics under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Markei\logs`. It does not own business meaning or SQL workflows.

## 11.5 Desktop-Specific Coupling

For the shortest Sprint 01 route, runtime resource and user-data helpers remain in `app/core/database.py`.

This is a desktop infrastructure coupling and not a ProductService, Repository, model, mobile, synchronization, or cross-device contract. Extraction to a desktop runtime-path module remains deferred.

## 11.6 Validation State

Validated:

- one-folder runtime generation;
- frozen executable launch;
- working-directory-independent schema lookup;
- schema-only empty first launch;
- external `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Markei` database;
- first receipt without a seeded store;
- startup logging;
- construction of Register, Lists, History, and Settings.

Configured but unvalidated:

- compiled installer;
- Start Menu installed launch;
- upgrade preservation;
- uninstall preservation;
- reinstall recovery;
- SmartScreen and antivirus behavior.
