# 1. System Map

```text
Flutter presentation
→ application / use cases
→ domain / contracts / versioned analytics
→ repository interfaces
→ local persistence / event queue / synchronization adapters
→ authenticated TypeScript synchronization API
→ Neon Postgres
```

```text
Python/PySide6 Cycle 06 beta
    preserved as behavioral reference, migration source, and rollback
    until Flutter parity receives human/Main acceptance
```

# 2. Responsibility Map

| Boundary | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Flutter presentation | Responsive Windows/mobile UI, navigation, input, accessibility, formatting |
| Application/use cases | Catalogue resolution, Register Purchase, projection reads, auth and sync requests |
| Domain/contracts | Identity, aggregate, quantity, money, event and invariant meaning |
| Dart analytics registry | Stable algorithm identifiers/versions and deterministic calculations |
| Repository interfaces | Application-facing persistence contracts |
| Local persistence | Application-private authoritative facts, applied events, projections and cursor |
| Event queue | Pending/in-flight/accepted/rejected upload state and safe retry |
| Sync coordinator | Upload, cursor download, transactional application and status |
| Auth session | Account/device session and platform-secure credential boundary |
| TypeScript API | Token verification, authorization, validation, idempotency, sequence, cursor and transactions |
| Neon | Managed Postgres persistence, constraints, roles, migrations and recovery facilities |

# 3. Domain Relationship Map

```text
Account
├── Products
├── Stores
├── Devices
└── Purchases
    └── Purchase Items
        └── reference Product
```

**Account** is the immutable ownership boundary. Verified email is replaceable login identity.

**Product** is an account-private reusable catalogue identity. PACKAGED identity includes normalized name, brand, package mode, amount and explicit dimension/unit. BULK identity omits package amount.

**Store** is an account-private reusable purchase reference.

**Purchase** is an atomic occurrence at one Store with timestamp and currency.

**Purchase Item** is an immutable commercial observation referencing one Product. The first UI may capture one Item; the aggregate supports several.

# 4. Event and Ordering Map

```text
purchase.registered envelope
    event UUID
    protocol + payload versions
    account UUID
    device UUID + monotonic device sequence
    occurrence timestamp
    Purchase aggregate + Item lines
```

```text
event UUID
    idempotent retry identity

device sequence
    per-installation creation order and gap detection

occurrence timestamp
    business time, not sync order

account cursor
    opaque server-accepted download position
```

Each event is accepted transactionally. Upload batches return per-event outcomes. Downloaded events and local cursor advancement commit together. A new device bootstraps from cursor zero in bounded pages.

# 5. Authoritative Facts and Projections

Authoritative:

- account/device ownership;
- Product and Store identities;
- Purchase and Purchase Item observations;
- dimensional quantity;
- explicit currency and minor-unit line totals;
- immutable accepted events and server ordering;
- explicit future correction facts when introduced.

Derived and rebuildable:

- package and normalized prices;
- purchase interval and expected next purchase;
- stock estimate;
- Storage/Shortage/Market status;
- price change;
- personal inflation/deflation;
- shrinkflation and product-family analytics;
- store comparison and forecasts;
- presentation labels/grouping.

Derived results use stable Dart algorithm identifiers and versions where reproducibility matters.

# 6. Local-First Transaction Map

```text
Register Purchase locally
→ validate aggregate
→ resolve/create catalogue references
→ commit Purchase + Items
→ append pending event
→ update/rebuild projection
→ commit once
→ synchronize later
```

```text
Apply remote page
→ insert unseen events
→ apply account-owned facts
→ rebuild affected projections
→ advance account cursor
→ commit once
```

Network work never stays inside the local database transaction.

# 7. Cloud Boundary

```text
Flutter client
    access token only
        ↓
TypeScript API
    authentication + authorization + protocol
        ↓
Neon Postgres
    no privileged client access
```

RLS may provide defense in depth; API authorization remains mandatory.

# 8. Transition and Evidence

```text
preserve PySide6 + original data
→ define contracts and fixtures
→ fresh isolated Flutter data
→ prove reduced Register/projection parity
→ prove sync on simulated devices
→ validate Windows + Android
→ validate iOS separately
→ deterministic protected-copy migration
→ human/Main acceptance
→ only then consider PySide6 retirement
```

# 9. Provisional or Open

Provisional: normalization v1, deterministic Product UUID, purchase snapshot minimum, cursor implementation, sequence recovery, decimal representation, fractional COUNT, RLS and legacy ambiguity policy.

Open: Flutter persistence/secure-storage/state/navigation choices, auth provider, TypeScript API framework/host, migration tool, physical local/cloud schemas, repository topology and parity threshold.

No candidate dependency or physical schema is validated or accepted by this derived overview.
