# 1. Entry State

Cycle 07 Sprint 02 is closed.

Completed:

```text
portable-core investigation
→ shared-application product direction
→ custom API + Neon direction
→ reusable catalogue
→ Purchase / Purchase Item aggregate
→ dimensional quantity and minor-unit money
→ append-only synchronization semantics
→ Flutter/Dart shared-client selection
→ TypeScript API preference
→ permanent Operational reconciliation
→ Didactic KANBAN promotion
→ permanent Design architecture reconciliation
→ Main-root refresh
```

Not materialized:

```text
Flutter project
Dart domain models
physical local schema
canonical fixture package
TypeScript API
physical Postgres schema
auth provider
Neon project
Windows/Android Flutter evidence
iOS evidence
legacy importer
D/E/F or G/H/I for Sprint 03
```

---

# 2. Sprint 03 Milestone

> Materialize and validate the first isolated Flutter/Dart local vertical slice and its fresh catalogue/purchase schema, while preserving the complete Python/PySide6 beta and preparing—but not yet requiring—the synchronization API boundary.

Sprint 03 should establish:

```text
isolated Flutter structure
→ Dart domain contracts
→ deterministic shared fixtures
→ fresh application-private local database
→ account-private reusable catalogue
→ atomic Purchase + Purchase Items + pending event
→ derived projection/analytics registry
→ close/reopen persistence
→ Windows and Android evidence
→ original Cycle 06 data untouched
```

A later Sprint 03 unit may introduce the local TypeScript/Postgres protocol harness only after the local Flutter model passes.

---

# 3. Transition Strategy

The transition is additive, not a rewrite-in-place.

```text
Existing Python/PySide6 implementation
    remains runnable
    remains packageable
    remains recoverable
    remains migration source
    remains rollback

New Flutter/Dart implementation
    uses fresh application-private data
    receives no privileged cloud credentials
    does not import Python runtime
    does not open the ordinary Cycle 06 database
    proves behavior through fixtures
```

No source file should be moved, renamed, or deleted merely to make room for Flutter.

The first D/E/F synthesis must authorize an exact repository layout before scaffolding. The intended responsibility topology is:

```text
existing Python desktop boundary
new Flutter shared-client boundary
language-neutral contracts/fixtures boundary
future TypeScript sync-API boundary
Sketch Notebook boundary
```

Candidate directory names are implementation decisions and must not be invented by Codex without D/E/F authorization.

---

# 4. First Materialization Units

Sprint 03 should be divided into bounded units.

## Unit 1 — Repository and toolchain isolation

Authorize:

- exact Flutter project path;
- pinned Flutter/Dart version;
- lockfile policy;
- Windows and Android host prerequisites;
- clean source-control scope;
- proof that Python entry points and tests remain unchanged;
- no iOS acceptance claim.

Pass:

```text
Flutter toolchain recorded
Flutter project analyzes/tests
Windows debug launch
Android emulator/device debug launch when available
Python beta still runs/tests
working tree contains only authorized scope
```

## Unit 2 — Contracts and fixtures

Define language-neutral fixture behavior for:

- packaged Product normalization;
- bulk Product normalization;
- exact identity equivalence;
- advisory fuzzy similarity;
- deterministic Product UUID candidate;
- one-item Purchase;
- multi-item Purchase;
- invalid Item rollback;
- dimensional quantity;
- minor-unit money;
- pending event envelope;
- projection/analytics version.

Pass requires identical expected semantics in fixture data independent of Python, Dart, or TypeScript classes.

## Unit 3 — Fresh Flutter-local schema

Materialize a new schema for the Flutter client. Do not modify the Cycle 06 schema in place.

Logical responsibilities:

```text
local account context
device identity and next sequence
Products
Stores
Purchases
Purchase Items
immutable events
pending upload queue
applied event identities
last account cursor
rebuildable projections
migration/import ledger
```

Physical table names, migration framework, and plugin APIs require D/E/F.

## Unit 4 — Local vertical slice

```text
initialize fresh local store
→ stage Purchase
→ select/create Store
→ resolve/create Product
→ add one Purchase Item through multi-item-capable aggregate
→ atomically commit facts + pending purchase.registered event
→ display rebuilt projection
→ close/reopen
→ verify facts, queue, and projection
```

No authentication, cloud, Neon, or TypeScript API is required for this first local slice.

## Unit 5 — Local protocol harness, only after Units 1–4

Candidate later unit:

```text
two isolated Flutter-local stores
+ local TypeScript API
+ disposable Postgres
+ fake/test account identity
→ upload
→ idempotent append
→ cursor download
→ second-device apply
```

Non-production Neon follows only after local protocol success.

---

# 5. Fresh Logical Data Model

The physical schema must be derived from these accepted responsibilities.

## Product

```text
product UUID
account UUID
normalization version
normalized name
normalized brand
PACKAGED or BULK
measurement kind
package amount
package unit
display values as required
lifecycle metadata
```

Identity:

```text
PACKAGED:
account + normalized name + brand + mode + kind + amount + unit

BULK:
account + normalized name + brand + mode
```

Fuzzy-similarity data is advisory and must not define unique identity.

## Store

```text
store UUID
account UUID
minimum display name
optional location metadata
lifecycle metadata
```

Store location may default currency but is not the sole persisted currency authority.

## Purchase

```text
purchase UUID
account UUID
store UUID
occurrence timestamp
currency code
aggregate-level observed facts
creation/source metadata
```

## Purchase Item

```text
item UUID
purchase UUID
product UUID
package count
purchased amount
measurement kind/unit
line total in minor units
promotion observation
optional bounded notes/expiration facts
```

## Synchronization event

```text
event UUID
account UUID
device UUID
device sequence
event type
payload version
purchase aggregate payload
occurrence timestamp
canonical content identity/hash as required
local queue state
server cursor after acceptance
```

## Projection and analytics metadata

Projections are rebuildable. When reproducibility requires it, cached analytical results record:

```text
analytic identifier
analytic version
input/fact boundary
calculation timestamp
rebuild status
```

Raw facts are never rewritten by analytic evolution.

---

# 6. Representation Rules

## Quantity

```text
measurement_kind:
    MASS | VOLUME | COUNT

canonical unit:
    KG | L | UNIT

normalized amount:
    fixed precision
```

Never infer mass from volume.

Open technical decisions for D/E/F:

- decimal implementation;
- scale/range;
- serialization;
- fractional COUNT policy.

## Money

```text
currency code
integer minor-unit amount
```

Account currency may default entry. Purchase retains explicit currency. Currency metadata must not assume every currency has two decimal places.

## Identity

UUIDs are required for account, device, Product, Store, Purchase, Item, and event.

Deterministic Product UUID remains provisional until canonicalization fixtures prove equivalence and version migration.

---

# 7. Flutter/Dart Architecture Boundary

Required inward dependency direction:

```text
Flutter presentation
→ application/use cases
→ domain contracts and analytics
→ repository interfaces
→ local persistence/event queue/sync adapters
```

Rules:

- widgets do not own SQL, transactions, or durable facts;
- use cases own workflow coordination;
- domain owns invariants and pure calculations;
- repository interfaces isolate storage;
- local transactions protect facts and queues;
- composition root owns platform adapters and lifecycle wiring;
- network calls never remain inside local database transactions;
- no Python IPC bridge;
- no direct Neon client credentials.

---

# 8. Candidate Dependencies

Experiment candidates:

```text
Drift
    first local-persistence candidate

sqflite_common_ffi
    retained comparison

flutter_secure_storage
    later credential candidate
```

They are not accepted dependencies until D/E/F authorize evaluation and G/H/I record evidence.

Sprint 03 local Units 1–4 do not require secure-token storage.

---

# 9. Validation Gates

## Repository safety

- branch is `cycle-07-mobile-preparation`;
- baseline remains an ancestor;
- Python source remains intact;
- ordinary Cycle 06 database path/hash remains untouched;
- no generated artifacts enter unrelated source scope.

## Dart and fixtures

- static analysis passes;
- unit tests pass;
- packaged/bulk normalization fixtures pass;
- Dart re-encoding preserves protocol semantics;
- fuzzy similarity never automatically merges;
- identity version is explicit.

## Local database

- fresh initialization;
- structural defaults only when required;
- foreign keys and uniqueness active;
- atomic Purchase/Items/event commit;
- invalid Item rolls back aggregate;
- close/reopen preserves data;
- migration from an empty/previous test schema is rehearsed;
- failure does not silently reset data.

## Projections and analytics

- facts remain authoritative;
- projections rebuild deterministically;
- analytic identifier/version is stable;
- expected Storage/Shortage/Market or bounded replacement projection matches fixture;
- package and normalized prices do not mutate raw facts.

## Platform

- Windows build/run;
- Android build/run when host/emulator/device is available;
- process termination/relaunch;
- app-private database path;
- iOS remains unvalidated until macOS/Xcode.

---

# 10. Explicit Non-Goals

Sprint 03 first transition does not include:

- purchase editing/deletion;
- product merge/alias workflow;
- global catalogue;
- household sharing;
- realtime/background synchronization;
- production auth;
- production Neon;
- app-store publication;
- PySide6 retirement;
- direct legacy database conversion;
- broad analytics suite;
- product-family/supersession UI;
- complete desktop parity;
- destructive repository reorganization.

---

# 11. D/E/F Authorization Boundary

This forward checkpoint prepares Sprint 03; it does not itself authorize materialization.

Main must prepare:

```text
D_OPS_STAGE
    exact commands, tools, environment, validation, and stop gates

E_DDC_STAGE
    learner checkpoints, fixtures, concept reinforcement, and evidence limits

F_DSN_STAGE
    exact repository topology, ownership, contracts, schema boundary,
    and permitted source files
```

Codex must stop if D/E/F:

- omit the exact Flutter project path;
- disagree on schema ownership;
- permit ordinary Cycle 06 data access;
- mix local Flutter slice with cloud provisioning;
- expand into deferred features;
- fail to name validation and rollback gates.

---

# 12. Sprint 03 Exit Boundary

The first Sprint 03 materialization unit succeeds only when:

```text
Flutter/Dart structure is isolated
Python/PySide6 remains recoverable
canonical fixtures exist
fresh Flutter-local schema initializes
catalogue identity behavior passes
one atomic Purchase with Item persists
pending event persists
projection rebuilds
close/reopen passes
Windows evidence exists
Android evidence exists or a precise host blocker is recorded
Cycle 06 database remains untouched
G/H/I report exact evidence
```

Synchronization API and Neon may remain unimplemented at this boundary. Cycle 07 itself remains open until the synchronized shared slice is eventually evidenced.

---

# 13. Recovery Route

```text
1. AGENTS.md
2. INDEX.md and methodology boot
3. 00_PROJECT_STATE.md
4. this file
5. relevant domain checkpoint
6. J sections 17–18
7. D/E/F once prepared
8. source files named by D/E/F only
```

Recovery warnings:

```text
Flutter selected for planning ≠ Flutter validated
logical schema ≠ physical schema
fresh Flutter database ≠ migrated desktop database
fixture parity ≠ full UI parity
Windows/Android evidence ≠ iOS evidence
local event queue ≠ synchronized cloud state
Sprint 03 local success ≠ Cycle 07 closure
```

---

<!-- TEMPORAL_MARKER:C07-S02-CLOSURE -->
