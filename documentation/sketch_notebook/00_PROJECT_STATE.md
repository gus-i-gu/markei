# 1. Global State

Cycle 06 is accepted and closed at the controlled Windows primary-beta boundary.

Cycle 07 Sprint 02 planning and permanent-domain reconciliation are complete. Cycle 07 now has an accepted planning basis for a Flutter/Dart shared client, TypeScript synchronization API, Neon Postgres shared persistence, reusable catalogue, append-only synchronization, and progressive migration from the protected PySide6 beta.

```text
Cycle 06 desktop beta: accepted and protected
Cycle 07 Sprint 01 portability investigation: complete
Cycle 07 Sprint 02 shared-beta architecture planning: complete
permanent Operational reconciliation: complete
permanent Didactic promotion: complete
permanent Design reconciliation: complete
Flutter/Dart planning basis: accepted
physical implementation: not started
D/E/F: not yet activated for Sprint 03
```

---

# 2. Protected Desktop Baseline

The accepted implementation remains:

```text
PySide6 Desktop
→ ProductService
→ Repository
→ Database Manager
→ SQLite
```

It includes the validated one-folder Windows runtime, per-user installer, Start Menu launch, external writable user data, structural defaults, technical workflows, close/reopen, reinstall retention, uninstall retention, and recovery evidence.

The existing Python application and ordinary Cycle 06 database remain:

- runnable and recoverable;
- behavioral reference and fixture source;
- legacy migration source;
- rollback boundary;
- excluded from direct Flutter opening or destructive conversion.

PySide6 is not retired until Flutter desktop/mobile parity and migration safety are evidenced and accepted.

---

# 3. Accepted Shared-Beta Planning Architecture

```text
Flutter presentation
→ application/use cases
→ domain contracts + versioned Dart analytics
→ repository interfaces
→ local persistence / event queue / synchronization adapters
→ authenticated TypeScript synchronization API
→ Neon Postgres
```

Stable boundaries:

- Flutter/Dart owns the future Windows/Android/iOS client.
- TypeScript is favored for the custom synchronization API.
- Neon is favored as managed shared persistence behind the API.
- Every installation remains offline-first with application-private storage.
- The API is the mandatory client/cloud boundary.
- Clients never contain privileged Postgres credentials.
- Verified email maps to an immutable internal account UUID.
- Python and Dart share behavior through contracts, fixtures, and migration evidence—not an embedded Python runtime.

---

# 4. Reusable Catalogue and Purchase Model

The first shared beta uses account-private reusable Products and Stores.

Packaged Product identity is based on:

```text
normalized name
+ normalized brand
+ PACKAGED
+ normalized package amount
+ explicit dimension/unit
```

Bulk identity uses:

```text
normalized name
+ normalized brand
+ BULK
```

Exact normalized equivalence may reuse an identity. Fuzzy similarity only warns and asks the user; it never merges automatically.

Domain relationship:

```text
Account
├── Catalogue Products
├── Stores
└── Purchases
    └── Purchase Items
        └── reference Catalogue Product
```

Purchase is an atomic aggregate containing one or more Items and one pending append-only synchronization event. The first UI may guide one Item while preserving a multi-item contract.

Product identity fields remain immutable in the reduced beta. Editing, deletion, merge/alias workflows, global catalogue, product-family relations, and household sharing remain deferred.

---

# 5. Quantity, Money, and Analytics

Quantity is dimensionally explicit:

```text
MASS   → KG
VOLUME → L
COUNT  → UNIT
```

Package amount, package count, and purchased amount are distinct. Markei never infers mass from volume.

Money uses explicit currency and integer minor units. Account currency may default the interface, while every Purchase retains historical currency evidence.

Raw Product, Store, Purchase, and Purchase Item facts remain authoritative. Storage, Shortage, Market, expected dates, price comparisons, personalized inflation/deflation, shrinkflation, store comparisons, and forecasts remain rebuildable analytics.

Dart analytics use stable algorithm identifiers and versions. A released version does not change meaning; improved formulas create a new version.

---

# 6. Synchronization Planning State

The first synchronized fact is an atomic `purchase.registered` event containing immutable Item lines and required account-private reference/bootstrap facts.

```text
event UUID
    retry identity and duplicate protection

device UUID + monotonic sequence
    one-installation creation order

occurrence timestamp
    business/purchase time

opaque account-scoped cursor
    accepted download order
```

Policies:

- identical retry returns prior acceptance;
- same UUID with different content is rejected;
- sequence gaps are rejected/requested;
- second device bootstraps from cursor zero in pages;
- upload requests return per-event transactional results;
- downloaded events and cursor advancement commit together locally;
- API authentication and authorization are mandatory;
- RLS remains an optional defense-in-depth question.

---

# 7. Didactic State

Cycle 07 Sprint 02 introduced the following concepts as Red:

```text
&&&06–&&&10
&&%05
&%%07–&%%17
%%%07
```

They cover stable identity, authentication, authorization, eventual consistency, historical integrity, immutable Dart models, reusable catalogue, normalization, purchase aggregation, synchronization, dimensional quantity, minor-unit money, versioned analytics, and Flutter.

No existing maturity changed.

---

# 8. Provisional and Open Choices

Experiment candidates—not validated dependencies:

- Drift;
- `sqflite_common_ffi`;
- `flutter_secure_storage`;
- local TypeScript API and disposable Postgres;
- fake/test identity issuer;
- later non-production Neon.

Still open:

- Flutter project/repository layout;
- state management and navigation;
- auth provider;
- TypeScript API framework/runtime/host;
- Postgres migration tooling;
- canonical schema/fixture toolchain;
- physical local/cloud schemas;
- decimal scale/ranges and fractional COUNT;
- currency metadata source;
- normalization-version migration;
- legacy ambiguity policy;
- RLS;
- paging limits and queue-corruption recovery;
- parity threshold for PySide6 retirement.

---

# 9. Next Milestone

Cycle 07 Sprint 03 should begin the first bounded transition from the current repository into Flutter/Dart and the new logical data model.

It must proceed additively:

```text
preserve Python/PySide6
→ approve Sprint 03 D/E/F
→ establish isolated Flutter/Dart structure
→ define canonical fixtures
→ materialize fresh Flutter-local schema
→ prove catalogue + Purchase aggregate locally
→ preserve Cycle 06 database
→ only then introduce local API/Postgres sync harness
```

The authoritative forward boundary is `06_SESSION_SCHEME.md`.

---

# 10. Recovery Route

```text
1. Read this file.
2. Read 06_SESSION_SCHEME.md for Sprint 03.
3. Read the relevant domain checkpoint.
4. Read J sections 17–18 for reconciliation rationale.
5. Read permanent canon for exact definitions.
6. Read A/B/C only for detailed planning evidence.
7. Inspect source when implementation truth is directly required.
```

# Cycle 07 Sprint 03 Closure / Sprint 04 Entry

## Current global state

Sprint 03 Unit 01 is closed as an implemented and locally unit-tested Flutter/Dart foundation.

```text
accepted Cycle 06 Python/PySide6 beta
+ additive Flutter client
+ independent Dart domain/application boundary
+ Drift fresh local persistence
+ account-private catalogue
+ Purchase/Purchase Item aggregate
+ atomic local event and pending queue
+ rollback and close/reopen tests
+ versioned semantic fixtures
+ permanent-domain reconciliation
```

Verified evidence:

- Flutter 3.44.6 and Dart 3.12.2;
- `flutter analyze` passed;
- nine Flutter tests passed;
- five Python regression tests passed;
- ordinary Cycle 06 database remained protected.

Generated but unvalidated: Windows, Android, and iOS target projects.

Not implemented: full Purchase UI, platform runtime/lifecycle, authentication, TypeScript API, Postgres/Neon, actual synchronization, legacy import, parity, or PySide6 retirement.

## Accepted Sprint 04 direction

Sprint 04 targets the local shared-client vertical slice before the synchronization harness:

```text
correct device sequence
→ establish Unicode-safe versioned identity
→ harden contract examples
→ minimal Flutter multi-item Purchase UI
→ local history/projection
→ close/reopen
→ Windows execution
→ Android execution or precise host blocker
```

TypeScript/Postgres synchronization remains the following candidate route.

## Mandatory entry defects

- Device sequence likely resets and is not accepted as monotonic.
- Portuguese/Unicode normalization is not stable.
- Product identifier semantics remain provisional.
- Purchase/event fixtures are not complete wire contracts.
- Schema upgrade/recovery is untested.
- Store deduplication is undefined.

## Authority state

Sprint 04 planning is accepted. Implementation remains inactive until the human approves the route/host actions and Main prepares new D/E/F. Cycle 07 remains open.

# Cycle 07 Sprint 04 Materialized State / Android Entry

## Current global truth

Sprint 04 is materially implemented.

```text
Product user code/internal ID separation: implemented
normalization v2: implemented/tested
device sequence correction: implemented/tested
Drift schema v2 migration: implemented/tested
shared_beta/v2 schemas/examples: implemented/tested
multi-item Purchase UI: implemented/widget-tested
local History UI: implemented/widget-tested
Flutter tests: 21 passed
Python regressions: 5 passed
Windows release build: passed
Windows startup smoke: passed
Windows manual interaction: pending human
Android: SDK absent; build/run not performed
```

The protected Python/PySide6 source and ordinary database remain unchanged.

## Evidence limits

Windows build and startup do not establish complete interaction, accessibility, responsive, or persistence acceptance. Human verification remains required.

Android and iOS remain platform-unvalidated.

The local event and pending queue are not synchronization.

## Documentation drift

Design and Didactic checkpoints reflect Sprint 04.

The Operational checkpoint is stale and still describes pre-materialization state. G, repository truth, J §22, and this global checkpoint supersede it until PDR2-O is rerun.

## Next accepted direction

The next Cycle 07 milestone is full Android implementation and validation:

```text
Android tooling installation
→ SDK/licenses/device readiness
→ stable application ID
→ persistent platform-neutral Device identity
→ debug APK build
→ emulator/physical-device launch
→ Purchase/History workflow
→ Android close/reopen persistence
→ narrow-layout, keyboard, back, rotation, lifecycle evidence
→ cross-platform regressions
```

TypeScript/API/Neon synchronization remains deferred.

## Authority

Android planning is accepted.

Android tool installation and source materialization require fresh Main D/E/F with explicit components, commands, approval gates, data isolation, validation, and rollback/stop conditions.

Cycle 07 remains open.

# Cycle 07 Closure / Cycle 08 Product-Beta Entry

> Main reconciliation: J §25  
> Status: active global checkpoint  
> Date: 2026-07-12

## Current global state

Cycle 07 is closed at the shared-client technical-foundation boundary.

```text
Cycle 06 Python/PySide6 Windows beta: accepted and protected
Cycle 07 Flutter/Dart shared foundation: accepted
Windows Flutter local workflow: human-validated
Android debug toolchain/build/install/launch: validated
Android Purchase registration and app-private persistence: human/runtime evidenced
persistent installation Device UUID: implemented and tested
Flutter tests: 27 passed
Windows Flutter build: passed
Python regressions: 5 passed
final UI/UX and production distribution: not accepted
authentication/API/Neon/synchronization: deferred
```

Cycle 07’s closure does not claim complete Android lifecycle, physical-device coverage, final accessibility, production signing, or public release. Keyboard, Back, rotation, background/resume, larger text, staged-state, and complete cold-relaunch behavior remain mandatory product-beta evidence in Cycle 08.

The current Device lookup is accepted only for the bounded prototype. Before real multi-device synchronization it requires an explicit current-installation relation and uniqueness/concurrency policy.

## Active cycle

Cycle 08 — Shared-Client Product Beta.

Objective:

> Convert the validated Windows/Android technical slice into a coherent local-first beta centred on reusable Catalogue interaction, improved Purchase registration, detailed History, responsive interface foundations, and one meaningful personal price-comparison view.

Cycle 08 priorities:

1. product journeys and responsive information architecture;
2. Catalogue search/reuse and advisory duplicate warning;
3. Store selection/creation;
4. staged Item edit/remove/review;
5. atomic Purchase registration and detailed History;
6. validation, empty, success, and failure states;
7. first personal price-comparison analytics;
8. migration, reopen, recovery, and backup/export decision;
9. Windows and Android manual acceptance.

Cloud synchronization remains architecturally preserved but inactive.

## Forward schedule

- Cycle 08: local shared-client product beta and UI/UX formalization.
- Cycle 09: account, TypeScript API, Neon, upload/download, cursor bootstrap, and convergence.
- Cycle 10: production hardening, signing, distribution, privacy, recovery, and controlled public beta.

## Current sprint and authority

Cycle 08 Sprint 01 is active as definition/investigation only.

It must produce Operational, Didactic, and Design staging for Main reconciliation. No Cycle 08 implementation, dependency addition, schema change, or host installation is currently authorized.

Read next:

1. `06_SESSION_SCHEME.md` latest checkpoint;
2. current domain checkpoint;
3. J §25;
4. repository UI/application source when the investigation requires it.

# Intermid Cycle Recovery Closure / Cycle 09 Entry

## Current global truth

The active product implementation is the local-first Flutter/Drift client under
`clients/markei_flutter/`. The protected Python/PySide6 beta remains isolated
and recoverable.

Implemented product surface:

- responsive Purchase, Products, and History destinations;
- reusable Product catalogue creation/search/reuse;
- Store selection or creation;
- session-owned multi-line Purchase draft with edit, remove, review, total, and
  guarded submission;
- one local registration transaction covering Store/Product resolution,
  Purchase, Items, Device sequence, SyncEvent, and PendingEvent;
- detailed local History and compatible personal price comparison;
- Drift schema v2 in app-private SQLite;
- persistent local Device identity;
- local event/pending preparation without remote synchronization.

## Recovery correction accepted

The staged-line edit defect is closed at
`409e5f1e013a282165efd5f31bed17a396ad6543`.

Presentation edit state now retains:

```text
line/edit key
ProductReference
Product label
```

Saving rebuilds only editable Purchase Item values. The directly tested
existing-Product path retains the original Product ID and creates no duplicate
Product. The common `ProductReference` path structurally supports new-Product
references, but that variant has no separate focused regression.

Recorded materialization evidence:

```text
focused app widget tests: 7 passed
full Flutter tests:       32 passed
Flutter analysis:         no issues
final blocker:            none within the bounded unit
```

## Permanent-memory reconciliation

Operational memory now classifies the defect as corrected while retaining
file-backed, migration, rollback, host, lifecycle, packaging, and release gates.

Didactic memory reinforces existing Stable Identity, Reusable Catalogue,
Purchase Item, and Evidence Boundary concepts. No new concept or KANBAN maturity
transition was justified.

Design memory accepts presentation-local edit identity ownership without
changing application ports, domain identities, repository transactions, Drift
schema, migration, composition, or navigation.

The permanent Operational model required no new stable rule in this bounded
unit; its existing model remains authoritative.

## Evidence limits carried forward

Not yet accepted:

- manual Windows Purchase → Products → History and close/reopen smoke;
- app-private file-backed restart and representative migration evidence;
- transaction rollback failure injection;
- Android Java/JDK recovery, current build/runtime/lifecycle evidence, and
  physical-device coverage;
- long-form phone-width, keyboard, Back, rotation, background/resume, larger
  text, and accessibility acceptance;
- production signing, distribution, backup/export/restore, or support contract;
- durable registration idempotency;
- authentication, API, Neon, upload/download, or convergence.

Local SyncEvent/PendingEvent storage remains synchronization preparation only.

## Active cycle

Cycle 09 — Database/UI Fine-Tuning.

Mission:

> Improve the MVP interface and local data model together, allowing persistence
> to expand only where an accepted user-facing workflow requires new facts,
> identity, lifecycle, query, or recovery behavior.

Cycle 09 supersedes the older schedule that placed account/API/Neon work
immediately after Cycle 08. Synchronization remains a later, separately
authorized cycle.

## Cycle 09 priority spine

```text
recover current UI/data contracts
→ identify the smallest MVP interaction gaps
→ prove file-backed and migration safety
→ select one UI-driven data decision
→ define domain and schema consequences
→ materialize one reversible vertical slice
→ validate UI, persistence, migration, and regression behavior
→ repeat only for remaining MVP-critical gaps
→ close with Windows/Android acceptance evidence
```

No schema v3 is assumed. A schema change requires an accepted UI/product need,
identity semantics, migration/recovery contract, and focused evidence.

## Cycle 09 candidate decision queue

Evaluate separately:

1. Store identity and duplicate/correction behavior;
2. durable Purchase submission identity and retry semantics;
3. Product correction/alias/merge boundaries;
4. installation–Device ownership timing;
5. draft persistence versus the accepted session-only promise;
6. History/Catalogue query budgets and measured index need;
7. export/restore and corruption-recovery expectations.

A candidate may be rejected or deferred. These decisions must not be combined
into one broad migration.

## Authority

Cycle 09 is active for recovery, investigation, prioritization, and staging
only. No source, schema, dependency, host, or synchronization materialization is
authorized until Main selects one bounded unit and freezes fresh D/E/F.

Read next:

1. `06_SESSION_SCHEME.md`, latest Cycle 09 entry;
2. the applicable domain checkpoint;
3. current repository source only where the selected investigation requires it.
