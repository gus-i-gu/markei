# 1. Main Synthesis Summary

Cycle 07 Sprint 01 completed the bounded portability investigation without modifying application code, initializing a mobile framework, installing toolchains, opening databases, or touching ordinary desktop user data.

The three functional reports agree that:

```text
Markei contains reusable behavior
≠
Markei is a portable mobile application as currently constructed
```

The likely reusable portion is concentrated in Python domain models, validation, date/status calculations, workflow meanings, schema semantics, and structural defaults. The current executable composition is not mobile-portable because service construction, repository creation, database-path resolution, resource loading, SQLite lifecycle, presentation projections, and shutdown ownership remain shaped by the desktop implementation.

The accepted investigation boundary remains:

```text
offline-first
single-device
fresh mobile-local data
no backend
no authentication
no synchronization
no ordinary desktop database access
```

Approach D, a service-backed client, has no demonstrated product requirement and remains deferred.

The evidence does not yet justify a final framework selection or D/E/F materialization. Main therefore postpones D/E/F. The next phase is documentation and specification refinement through A/B/C and J, followed by a later human/Main decision on whether a prototype is necessary and which uncertainty it should test.

---

# 2. Cycle and Baseline Integrity

Cycle 06 remains accepted and closed at the controlled Windows primary-beta boundary.

Cycle 07 began from:

```text
repository: gus-i-gu/markei
branch: cycle-07-mobile-preparation
baseline: f6414fbe7394453387067a5a34ca6cc7621bbed3
```

The isolated `markei-mobile` working copy and Cycle 07 branch preserve the accepted desktop baseline.

The three inherited domain checkpoints still contain pre-acceptance Cycle 06 language. This remains classified as checkpoint drift:

```text
Main-root continuity
    owns accepted Cycle 06 closure and Cycle 07 direction

domain checkpoints
    remain useful for domain detail
    but require later refresh
```

Nothing in Sprint 01 reopens Cycle 06.

GitHub remains the canonical Sketch Notebook host. Notion remains only a possible future projection or recovery layer; no authority or migration is active.

---

# 3. Reconciled Portability Map

## 3.1 Platform-neutral and likely reusable

Current evidence supports likely reuse of:

- Python domain dataclasses and core vocabulary;
- validation and calculation rules;
- purchase-duration and expected-date behavior;
- status classification meanings;
- structural-default semantics;
- schema facts and relationships as a semantic reference;
- repository and service responsibilities as design concepts;
- existing deterministic desktop behavior as a source for fixtures.

Likely reusable does not mean proven inside a mobile runtime.

## 3.2 Platform-neutral but coupled by construction

Current evidence identifies these coupled surfaces:

- `ProductService` constructs a concrete `Repository`;
- repository construction opens concrete SQLite lifecycle behavior;
- abstract contracts do not cover every method actually used;
- database and resource paths are resolved through desktop/Windows-shaped assumptions;
- service projections contain labels, formatting, grouping, and page-order choices;
- transaction boundaries remain split across independently committed repository methods.

These surfaces are candidates for later seams or specifications. Sprint 01 does not authorize refactoring them.

## 3.3 Desktop-specific

Desktop-specific ownership remains in:

- PySide6 application creation and event-loop ownership;
- `app/desktop/` pages, widgets, dialogs, and navigation;
- page-owned service construction;
- MainWindow shutdown coordination;
- Windows/PyInstaller packaging and diagnostic surfaces;
- installed Windows path and lifecycle behavior.

These surfaces should be preserved as the accepted desktop implementation rather than treated as mobile assets.

## 3.4 Persistence-specific

SQLite schema semantics remain credible for an offline mobile prototype, but the following are not yet portable evidence:

- mobile sandbox path resolution;
- packaged schema-resource access;
- connection behavior within a chosen mobile runtime;
- WAL/file-lock behavior;
- suspend/resume and process-termination behavior;
- migrations and transaction ownership;
- uninstall, backup, and restore behavior;
- parity between desktop and mobile stores.

A mobile prototype must own a fresh sandboxed database. It must not open, copy, or mutate the ordinary desktop database.

## 3.5 Unknown until tested

No report establishes:

- a functioning mobile runtime;
- a selected UI framework;
- Android build or device launch;
- iOS build or device launch;
- packaged SQLite compatibility;
- lifecycle persistence across mobile termination/relaunch;
- mobile accessibility or performance;
- store distribution;
- semantic parity across two runtime implementations;
- safe cross-device synchronization.

These remain experiment candidates, not accepted facts.

---

# 4. Approach Reconciliation

## 4.1 Approach A — Shared Python core with Python-native mobile UI

Operational identifies Approach A as the lowest-cost Android falsification experiment because it maximizes direct Python reuse and can quickly test whether the existing core survives mobile packaging.

Its primary uncertainties are:

- Android packaging through an additional Linux/WSL, SDK/NDK, JDK, emulator/device, and framework toolchain;
- iOS dependence on macOS/Xcode and a separate packaging path;
- mobile lifecycle and SQLite compatibility;
- accessibility, navigation, and platform integration;
- whether required construction/path seams stay genuinely bounded.

Main classification:

```text
best short falsification challenger
not accepted long-term architecture
```

## 4.2 Approach B — Web/hybrid mobile presentation

Approach B may fit existing web familiarity and rapid UI work, but it cannot directly execute the current Python core in an ordinary hybrid client. It therefore requires:

- ported business behavior;
- a local bridge/runtime;
- or a service boundary.

It also needs a durable local relational-store strategy rather than treating browser preference storage as Markei’s ledger.

Main classification:

```text
viable secondary candidate
not currently the smallest evidence path
```

## 4.3 Approach C — Native/cross-platform client with explicit contracts and fixtures

Design recommends Approach C as the primary architectural candidate because it gives mobile presentation, lifecycle, local persistence, navigation, and platform integration explicit ownership.

This route reuses semantics rather than necessarily reusing Python runtime code. It requires language-neutral contracts and deterministic fixtures to control drift between desktop and mobile implementations.

Its cost is a second implementation and stronger fixture/contract discipline.

Main classification:

```text
primary strategic architecture candidate
framework not selected
implementation not authorized
```

## 4.4 Approach D — Service-backed client

No accepted requirement currently demands accounts, multi-device state, household collaboration, or cloud synchronization. A backend would add hosting, authentication, privacy, network failure, API compatibility, offline queues, conflict resolution, and operational support without removing the need for mobile-local persistence.

Main classification:

```text
deferred unless a demonstrated requirement activates it
```

---

# 5. Main Decision Boundary

Main does not treat the difference between Operational and Design as a contradiction.

They answer different questions:

```text
Operational:
What is the cheapest experiment that can falsify direct Python reuse?

Design:
What architecture is strongest if mobile becomes a maintained product?
```

The current reconciled position is:

```text
Approach C
    primary strategic candidate

Approach A
    bounded challenger / falsification spike

Approach B
    viable secondary route

Approach D
    deferred
```

Before any prototype authorization, the project should specify the behavior to preserve independently of framework choice.

---

# 6. Contract and Fixture Direction

The next useful artifact is conceptual specification, not application code.

Candidate behavior scenarios include:

1. first purchase for a new product;
2. repeat purchase and duration recalculation;
3. Storage/Shortage/Market status transition;
4. invalid receipt rejection;
5. structural category/store defaults;
6. close/reopen persistence;
7. one atomic registration workflow;
8. mobile-local path isolation.

A later contract/fixture design should describe:

- typed input facts;
- stable output facts and status codes;
- validation failures;
- date and quantity semantics;
- expected persistence effects;
- deterministic example values;
- invariants across desktop and mobile;
- presentation-owned labels and formatting excluded from the contract.

Current Python abstract classes and UI-facing dictionaries are evidence sources, not automatically the final cross-platform contract.

No new shared-specification directory or file is authorized by this J revision. Any new notebook or implementation file still requires explicit Main/human authorization and routing review.

---

# 7. D/E/F Postponement

The following files are intentionally not prepared:

```text
DEV_STAGE/D_OPS_STAGE.md
DEV_STAGE/E_DDC_STAGE.md
DEV_STAGE/F_DSN_STAGE.md
```

Reason:

```text
no implementation is currently requested
+
framework selection remains open
+
contract/fixture boundary remains underspecified
+
documentation reconciliation can reduce uncertainty first
```

Existing D/E/F content, if present from an earlier cycle, must not be interpreted as Cycle 07 authorization.

D/E/F may be activated later only after Main/human direction selects a bounded materialization unit.

---

# 8. Documentation-First Next Phase

The next phase should use A/B/C as renewable staging surfaces and J as the cross-domain gathering and reconciliation surface.

## 8.1 Operational continuation through A

Operational may refine `A_OPERATIONAL.md` with a compact documentation delta covering:

- host and toolchain inventory questions;
- evidence needed to compare one A-family and one C-family toolchain;
- Android-accessible versus macOS/iOS-only gates;
- reproducible prototype validation matrix;
- mobile-local path and ordinary-desktop-data isolation checks;
- lifecycle and persistence failure taxonomy;
- criteria for stopping a failed spike;
- exact unknowns that require execution rather than further reading.

Operational should not install tools or execute the prototype during this documentation phase.

## 8.2 Didactic continuation through B

Didactic may refine `B_DIDACTIC.md` with:

- explicit KANBAN candidates;
- dependency order for platform boundary, composition root, dependency injection, DTO/contract, golden fixture, local persistence, transaction boundary, offline-first, synchronization, and lifecycle ownership;
- learner-facing distinctions between reuse of code, behavior, schema, and vocabulary;
- maturity-preserving questions for the human learner;
- glossary candidates derived only from accepted or staged concepts;
- a compact learning checkpoint for the later prototype.

No maturity promotion or permanent KANBAN update should occur without the Didactic protocol and explicit learner evidence.

## 8.3 Design continuation through C

Design may refine `C_DESIGN.md` with:

- a technology-neutral use-case boundary;
- candidate command/result contract shapes;
- fixture ownership and semantic-parity rules;
- mobile composition-root and lifecycle ownership;
- local transaction boundary;
- schema reuse versus semantic-schema equivalence;
- repository topology options without selecting a permanent split;
- comparison criteria for candidate C-family frameworks;
- explicit conditions under which the A-family challenger should be attempted or rejected.

Design should not create implementation contracts or reorganize source code during this phase.

## 8.4 Main continuation through J

Main should gather subsequent A/B/C deltas into this J file by:

1. identifying agreements;
2. preserving genuine domain tensions;
3. classifying facts, assumptions, unknowns, and deferrals;
4. pruning duplicate cross-domain wording;
5. deciding whether additional documentation can answer the next question;
6. identifying when an empirical experiment becomes necessary;
7. selecting at most one bounded D/E/F materialization unit when authorized.

J remains staging. It does not replace permanent domain memory or Main-root continuity.

---

# 9. Permanent Documentation Reconciliation Candidates

After one documentation refinement round, functional chats may propose—not automatically perform—updates to permanent domain memory.

## Operational candidates

```text
operational/10_OPERATIONAL_STATE.md
    refresh Cycle 06 closure and Cycle 07 investigation state

operational/04_TODO.md
    express evidence gaps and future experiment gates

operational/12_OPERATIONAL_MODEL.md
    add stable mobile-investigation validation rules only if sufficiently general

operational/11_OPERATIONAL_RECORD.md
    append Sprint 01 investigation chronology
```

## Didactic candidates

```text
didactics/08_CONCEPT_MAP.md
    refresh current Cycle 07 learning boundary

didactics/02_KANBAN.md
    add concepts only after classification and learner protocol

didactics/07_GLOSSARY.md
    derive terms from accepted KANBAN concepts

didactics/13_LECTURE_REGISTER.md
    record the portability investigation and learner evidence
```

## Design candidates

```text
design/09_DESIGN_STATE.md
    refresh current portable-core and mobile-boundary state

design/14_MODEL_OVERVIEW.md
    derive a compact platform-boundary overview

design/01_ARCHITECTURE.md
    update only after an architecture decision becomes accepted

design/03_DECISION_LOG.md
    record alternatives, deferrals, and later accepted decisions
```

Permanent updates must follow `FLUX.md` and `PROMOTION_RULES.md`. A/B/C content must be classified rather than copied wholesale.

---

# 10. Proposed Next Steps

Recommended immediate sequence:

```text
1. Human/Main reviews this reconciliation.
2. A/B/C perform one documentation-refinement round if desired.
3. Main gathers the deltas in J.
4. Functional chats classify permanent-domain update candidates.
5. Domain checkpoints are refreshed to remove Cycle 06 closure drift.
6. Main decides whether documentation is sufficient.
7. If empirical evidence is required, select one bounded experiment.
8. Only then prepare D/E/F.
```

The most useful next decision question is:

> Should the project first formalize language-neutral behavior contracts and fixtures, or first run a time-boxed Python-native Android falsification spike to test whether direct core reuse is viable?

Main currently recommends contract/fixture specification first because it benefits every approach and reduces the risk that a framework spike tests only packaging while leaving semantic portability undefined.

---

# 11. Scope Guard

This J revision does not authorize:

- application or source-code modification;
- framework initialization;
- tool installation;
- Android or iOS build execution;
- database migration or ordinary-user-data access;
- backend, authentication, synchronization, or hosting;
- permanent repository split;
- new Sketch Notebook files;
- methodology modification;
- D/E/F materialization;
- automatic permanent-domain promotion.

# 13. Permanent-Domain Absorption Result

Operational, Didactic, and Design completed the authorized permanent-memory reconciliation pass.

Materialized domain updates:

```text

    didactics/13_LECTURE_REGISTER.md

Design
    design/09_DESIGN_STATE.md
    design/03_DECISION_LOG.md
```

Main classification:

- checkpoints now reflect Cycle 06 closure and active Cycle 07 investigation;
- observational files preserve both the Python-native challenger and contract-first strategic pathway;
- the human/Main preference for the Design pathway is recorded as provisional planning direction;
- development cost is described across learning, setup, rewriting, toolchains, testing, lifecycle, semantic parity, distribution, and maintenance;
- no Didactic maturity changed;
- no framework, permanent repository topology, backend, or implementation architecture was accepted;
- no application, methodology, D/E/F, or Codex-report files were modified;
- no further J synthesis is required before the Main-root continuity refresh.

Current reconciled position:

```text
primary strategic direction
    contract-first native/cross-platform client

bounded challenger
    time-boxed Python-native Android falsification experiment

next required knowledge
    language-neutral behavior scenarios
    deterministic fixtures
    explicit validation and stop criteria

implementation authorization
    none

D/E/F
    postponed
```

The next cycle step remains documentation/specification work. Main should activate D/E/F only when the human requests an empirical prototype and one bounded uncertainty has been selected.


---

# 14. Shared Beta Planning Activation

## 14.1 Human/Main direction

The human developer has activated planning for an actual shared Markei beta spanning desktop and mobile.

Favored product direction:

```text
one shared cross-platform application
+
local-first persistence on every installation
+
verified-email user account
+
small custom synchronization API
+
Neon Postgres shared synchronization store
+
append-only first synchronization slice
```

This direction supersedes the earlier assumption that backend and synchronization remain wholly outside near-term planning. It does not authorize implementation yet.

Approach C remains the favored client direction. The cloud boundary is now activated as a planning concern because synchronized desktop/mobile state is an explicit human requirement.

## 14.2 Responsibility boundary

```text
Email authentication
    proves account access and resolves an immutable account ID

Local database
    supports offline use and durable device-local state

Synchronization API
    owns upload/download protocol, validation, idempotency,
    authorization, cursors, and protocol versions

Neon Postgres
    stores shared account-scoped synchronization facts

Shared client
    owns responsive desktop/mobile presentation, local use cases,
    local projections, pending-event queue, and sync application
```

Clients must not embed a privileged Neon connection string or connect directly with shared database credentials.

## 14.3 Reduced first synchronized slice

The first synchronized beta should support only:

```text
verified email registration/sign-in
→ immutable account UUID
→ per-installation device UUID
→ local database initialization
→ offline purchase registration
→ append-only local purchase event
→ authenticated event upload
→ idempotent server acceptance
→ server cursor assignment
→ second device downloads unseen events
→ deterministic local projection rebuild
→ close/reopen persistence
```

Explicitly excluded from the first slice:

- purchase editing;
- purchase deletion;
- concurrent product renaming;
- household sharing;
- multi-account roles;
- real-time push;
- background synchronization;
- conflict-resolution UI;
- desktop database-file transfer;
- complete settings synchronization;
- broad schema redesign;
- app-store publication;
- production scaling claims.

## 14.4 Initial synchronization event requirements

A planning candidate event should contain at least:

```text
event_id
account_id
device_id
device_sequence
entity_type
entity_id
operation_type
payload
client_created_at
server_received_at or server sequence
schema_version
```

Timestamps alone are not accepted as ordering or duplicate protection.

Required properties:

- globally unique event identity;
- per-device ordering;
- safe retry through idempotency;
- server-owned incremental cursor;
- authenticated account ownership;
- deterministic application into local state;
- schema/protocol versioning;
- transactional local application.

The authoritative first synchronized facts should be purchase events and necessary identity/reference facts. Calculated projections such as average duration, expected purchase date, and Storage/Shortage/Market classification should be rebuilt deterministically where possible rather than synchronized as competing mutable values.

## 14.5 Custom API preference

The custom synchronization API is favored over direct client table access because it provides one owner for:

- authentication-token validation;
- account authorization;
- event validation;
- idempotent append;
- batch upload;
- cursor-based download;
- transaction semantics;
- protocol versions;
- observability;
- future conflict policy.

Neon is favored as managed Postgres infrastructure. It reduces database operations but does not define synchronization semantics.

Authentication provider selection remains open. Verified email is a product requirement; Neon Auth may be evaluated, but its current Beta status prevents automatic acceptance.

## 14.6 Planning phases

```text
Phase 1 — Shared local application specification
    responsive desktop/mobile client boundary
    local schema and lifecycle
    shared contracts and deterministic fixtures
    no cloud dependency required for core workflow

Phase 2 — Synchronization protocol specification
    identities
    append-only events
    idempotency
    per-device order
    server cursor
    upload/download batches
    failure and retry behavior

Phase 3 — Small API + Neon prototype
    verified account
    authenticated append
    cursor download
    two-device semantic parity
    offline/reconnect lifecycle

Phase 4 — Shared beta validation
    desktop and mobile builds
    local persistence
    cross-device propagation
    retry/duplicate safety
    ordinary Cycle 06 desktop data protected
    bounded security and operational evidence
```

## 14.7 Required domain planning before D/E/F

Operational should plan:

- local development and hosted environments;
- Neon, API runtime, auth, secrets, migrations, logs, and test prerequisites;
- two-device sync validation;
- offline/reconnect, retry, duplicate, and cursor gates;
- minimum deployment and rollback evidence.

Didactic should plan:

- authentication versus authorization;
- local persistence versus synchronization;
- event identity, idempotency, ordering, cursors, eventual consistency;
- authoritative facts versus derived projections;
- API and managed-database responsibilities;
- learner dependency order.

Design should plan:

- shared client boundary;
- local store and pending-event queue;
- immutable account/device/entity/event identities;
- append-only event contract;
- custom API endpoints and ownership;
- Neon schema responsibilities and row ownership;
- projection rebuild and transaction boundaries;
- explicit deferrals and migration path from the accepted PySide6 beta.

Main should reconcile A/B/C into one shared-beta architecture plan before authorizing D/E/F.

## 14.8 Current authorization state

```text
shared synchronized beta planning: active
human product preference: recorded
architecture: not yet accepted
framework: not selected
auth provider: not selected
API runtime/host: not selected
Neon project/schema: not created
implementation: not authorized
D/E/F: postponed pending domain planning
```

# 15. Sprint 02 Shared-Beta Reconciliation and Reusable Catalogue Orientation

## 15.1 Main synthesis

The Sprint 02 Operational, Didactic, and Design reports converge on a coherent planning architecture:

```text
shared cross-platform client
→ application-private local database
→ local transaction and pending-event queue
→ authenticated custom synchronization API
→ account-scoped append-only event history
→ Neon Postgres
```

Each client remains usable offline. The API is not a transparent database tunnel: it owns authentication-token validation, authorization, event validation, idempotency, ordering/cursors, protocol compatibility, transactions, and diagnostics. Neon owns managed shared persistence, not synchronization meaning.

The smallest credible evidence target is a two-device protocol slice before a broad UI rewrite. It must prove local-first registration, safe retry, account isolation, cursor download, transactional local application, deterministic projection rebuild, restart recovery, and protection of the accepted Cycle 06 database.

The human-proposed Reusable Catalogue Perspective is accepted into Main staging as the preferred structural direction for further definition:

> Markei should separate relatively stable household catalogue identities from purchase-specific commercial observations. Purchases reference reusable product identities while retaining the variable facts observed at each acquisition. Historical price and consumption analysis should derive from the sequence of purchase observations rather than duplicated current product state.

This is structural orientation, not a finalized schema or implementation authorization.

## 15.2 Reconciled structural model

The previous Design event draft treats `purchase.registered` as the first synchronized fact and includes product/store bootstrap information in its payload. The reusable-catalogue perspective refines this into three distinct domain roles:

```text
Catalogue Product
    relatively stable household identity

Purchase Event
    one timestamped acquisition/receipt context at one store

Purchase Item
    one product observation within that purchase
    with quantity, package, price, promotion, and other commercial facts
```

Candidate relationship:

```text
Account
├── Catalogue Products
├── Stores
└── Purchase Events
    └── Purchase Items
        └── reference Catalogue Product
```

This prevents the purchase event from becoming both receipt header and product line. It also preserves a natural path toward one receipt containing several products without requiring that broader UI in the first synchronized slice.

The reduced first slice may still register one purchase with one item. The model should avoid making “one purchase always equals one product” a permanent invariant.

## 15.3 Stable catalogue identity versus historical observation

Candidate stable catalogue facts:

- account-scoped product UUID;
- preferred product name;
- brand;
- package or variant specification;
- category identity;
- lifecycle metadata required for synchronization.

Candidate purchase-event facts:

- purchase UUID;
- account UUID;
- store UUID;
- occurrence date/time;
- optional receipt-level totals or reference;
- creation/source metadata.

Candidate purchase-item facts:

- purchase-item UUID;
- purchase UUID;
- catalogue-product UUID;
- quantity purchased;
- measurement/unit;
- unit price;
- line total;
- promotion observation;
- optional expiration/depletion observation;
- product/package/store snapshot fields required for historical interpretation.

The exact allocation remains open. “Stable” means relatively reusable, not timeless. Product names, brands, package sizes, categories, and store names can change. Historical meaning must not be silently rewritten when the current catalogue entry changes.

## 15.4 Authoritative facts and projections

The following should remain authoritative candidates:

```text
catalogue identity facts
purchase event facts
purchase-item commercial observations
accepted synchronization event identities/order
explicit correction or lifecycle facts when later introduced
```

The following should normally remain derived:

```text
average duration
expected next purchase
current stock estimate
Storage / Shortage / Market classification
price-change percentages
personalized inflation/deflation indicators
store comparisons
expenditure forecasts
formatted labels and groupings
```

Derived analytics must be reproducible from accepted facts and versioned calculation rules. They should not be synchronized as competing mutable truth unless later evidence identifies a specific need.

## 15.5 Newly raised architectural questions

The reports introduce the following questions for Main/human definition.

### A. Shared client and migration

1. Which cross-platform client family will eventually own Windows, Android, and iOS?
2. Will the new client progressively replace PySide6 after parity, as Design recommends?
3. What evidence constitutes sufficient desktop workflow parity?
4. How long must the PySide6 beta and original database remain recoverable?
5. Will the shared client remain in the same repository during transition?
6. How will current integer/text identities map deterministically to UUIDs?
7. Will legacy import emit append-only events, or import catalogue/purchase facts through a separate controlled migration route?

### B. Account and catalogue ownership

8. Is the catalogue owned by one account, one future household, or another workspace boundary?
9. Is a product identity private to an account, or can identities later reference a wider canonical product catalogue?
10. Does the first beta deliberately avoid global product deduplication?
11. Can two catalogue products share the same name/brand/package while remaining distinct?
12. What rules identify “the same product” after spelling, brand, package, or unit changes?
13. Are category and store reusable account-scoped catalogue entities?
14. Which email/auth provider subject maps to the immutable internal account UUID?

### C. Product variants and historical snapshots

15. Is package specification part of product identity?
16. Does changing package size create a new catalogue product/variant?
17. Which product/store/category values are copied as immutable snapshots into purchase items?
18. If a catalogue name or brand changes, what should old History rows display?
19. Are current catalogue corrections allowed before purchase editing exists?
20. How will aliasing or merging duplicate catalogue entries work later without rewriting history?
21. Does a purchase event need sufficient bootstrap facts for a second device to create missing catalogue references?

### D. Purchase and purchase-item granularity

22. Is the synchronized domain event `purchase.registered`, `purchase_item.recorded`, or a receipt-level event containing item lines?
23. Is one receipt/purchase uploaded atomically as one event?
24. Can one invalid item reject an entire purchase, or may items be accepted independently?
25. Does the first slice model one purchase with one item while preserving a multi-item contract?
26. Where do receipt-level store, date, total, discount, and payment facts belong?
27. How are promotions represented without expanding into a broad pricing engine?

### E. Quantity, price, currency, and analytics

28. What are the canonical representations for quantity and unit?
29. How are package count, weight/volume, and purchased quantity distinguished?
30. Are money values stored as integer minor units, fixed-precision decimal, or another representation?
31. Is currency explicit on every purchase or inherited from account settings?
32. Is unit price stored, derived from line total/quantity, or both with validation?
33. Which price basis powers comparison: package price, normalized unit price, line total, or several views?
34. How are promotion quantities and multi-unit offers preserved historically?
35. Which time and normalization rules define personalized inflation/deflation calculations?
36. How are calculation-rule versions recorded when analytics evolve?

### F. Synchronization semantics

37. Is the server cursor global, account-scoped, or partitioned another way?
38. Are upload batches whole-batch atomic or per-event atomic?
39. What happens when a device sequence has a gap?
40. Can a client retry a logically identical event with different content under the same event UUID?
41. Which stable error codes are required?
42. How is a second device bootstrapped from cursor zero when event history grows?
43. Are reference/catalogue events separate from purchase events, or embedded as bootstrap snapshots?
44. Which corrections will later require compensating events rather than mutation?
45. Is row-level security required as defense in depth behind mandatory API authorization?

### G. API, authentication, and operations

46. Will the first protocol API use TypeScript or Python?
47. Which runtime/host provides the smallest reproducible environment?
48. Which verified-email/OIDC provider supports Windows, Android, and iOS securely?
49. How are refresh credentials stored on every platform?
50. What logs are sufficient without exposing tokens or purchase notes?
51. How are migrations rehearsed and rolled back?
52. When should local Postgres testing advance to a non-production Neon environment?
53. What low-cost quotas or cold-start behavior could invalidate the prototype assumptions?

## 15.6 Questions ready for provisional Main definition

The following can be staged now without framework execution:

```text
catalogue ownership
    account-scoped for the first beta

global product catalogue
    deferred

domain shape
    Catalogue Product → Purchase Event → Purchase Item

first workflow
    one purchase with one item,
    contract remains capable of multiple items

historical integrity
    purchase observations are not rewritten by catalogue edits

client database
    local-first and application-private

shared database access
    only through authenticated custom API

account ownership key
    immutable account UUID, never email string

sync style
    append-only first slice

duplicate protection
    event UUID + account-scoped uniqueness

device ordering
    device UUID + monotonic device sequence

download ordering
    opaque server-owned cursor

business time
    client occurrence time retained but not global ordering authority

projections
    rebuilt deterministically from authoritative facts

backend
    small custom synchronization API + Neon favored

desktop migration
    progressive replacement only after parity;
    PySide6 and original data remain recoverable

editing/deletion
    deferred

D/E/F
    postponed
```

These are planning definitions. Permanent architecture promotion still requires domain-memory classification and human/Main acceptance.

## 15.7 Questions requiring the next definition round

The next Design/Operational/Didactic documentation pass should prioritize:

1. catalogue identity and variant rules;
2. purchase-event versus purchase-item event granularity;
3. historical snapshot policy;
4. quantity/unit/money/currency representation;
5. minimum multi-item-capable purchase contract;
6. whole-batch versus per-event atomicity;
7. device-sequence-gap policy;
8. server cursor scope;
9. TypeScript versus Python protocol harness;
10. authentication provider criteria;
11. deterministic migration identity mapping;
12. fixture scenarios for price analytics and projection parity.

No framework, provider, schema, API, or infrastructure should be materialized until Main reconciles this definition round.

## 15.8 Didactic promotion direction

The human has clarified that KANBAN promotion may occur during model-design cycles when relevant concepts are genuinely approached and can be defined with reusable meaning. Implementation evidence is not a prerequisite for concept introduction, although maturity still requires explicit learner evidence.

Didactic may therefore evaluate canonical promotion for:

- Stable Identity;
- Authentication;
- Authorization;
- Append-Only Event;
- Idempotency;
- Event Ordering;
- Synchronization Cursor;
- Eventual Consistency;
- Authoritative Fact and Derived Projection, reconciled with existing `&&&02`;
- Sync Protocol;
- Offline Queue;
- Schema and Protocol Versioning;
- Reusable Catalogue;
- Purchase Event and Purchase Item;
- Historical Snapshot.

Promotion must preserve unique concept ownership, marker sequences, prerequisite relationships, and glossary derivation. No maturity color should change automatically.

## 15.9 Current status

```text
Sprint 02 A/B/C planning reports: received
Main shared-beta reconciliation: staged
reusable catalogue perspective: accepted as structural orientation
shared client + custom API + Neon: favored planning architecture
first slice: append-only, one purchase / one item, multi-item-capable
new architectural questions: classified
KANBAN promotion: permitted through Didactic protocol
implementation authorization: none
D/E/F: postponed
next step: domain documentation and definition round
```

# 16. Human/Main Structural Definitions and TypeScript Exploration Direction

## 16.1 Catalogue identity

The first shared beta defines an account-private catalogue product through this normalized identification set:

```text
normalized product name
+
normalized product brand
+
measurement mode
+
normalized package amount and unit, when packaged
```

Rules:

- a brand change creates a different Product ID;
- a packaged amount/size change creates a different Product ID;
- packaged products include normalized package amount/unit in identity;
- bulk/weighted products use `BULK` mode and omit package amount from identity;
- products remain private to one account;
- global catalogue deduplication is deferred;
- exact normalized equivalence may reuse an existing product automatically;
- fuzzy textual similarity only warns and requests user clarification;
- Markei must not merge products automatically from similarity alone;
- spelling correction and manual deduplication are deferred.

A deterministic account-scoped Product UUID derived from the normalized identification set is favored for evaluation because two offline devices can then resolve mechanically equivalent identities such as `350 g` and `0.350 kg` to the same Product ID. Its correction/migration implications still require fixture evidence.

## 16.2 Purchase registration structure

The accepted planning flow is:

```text
stage purchase
→ create purchase UUID and occurrence timestamp
→ select/create account-private store
→ add one or more purchase items
→ resolve Product ID directly or through identification set
→ exact match reuses catalogue product
→ similar match asks user
→ no match creates catalogue product
→ commit purchase aggregate atomically
→ append pending synchronization event
```

The first UI may stage one item at a time. The domain contract must support one purchase containing several purchase items.

## 16.3 Historical integrity and package change

Product identification properties are treated as immutable in the first beta. A changed name, brand, or package identity produces a new Product ID rather than rewriting an existing identity.

Therefore, broad duplicated product snapshots on every purchase item are not required initially. Purchase items preserve historical meaning by retaining their original Product ID and commercial observations.

A future relation may express:

```text
new product supersedes prior product
or
both variants belong to one analytical product family
```

This is useful for package shrinkage and long-range analytics but is deferred from the reduced synchronized slice.

## 16.4 Currency representation

Household purchases normally use the territorial currency associated with the account/store context. The interface may infer and default that currency so ordinary entry does not ask the user repeatedly.

Persisted commercial facts must nevertheless retain an explicit standard currency code. Store location alone must not be the only historical currency evidence.

Planning representation:

```text
account default currency
+ purchase currency code
+ money stored as integer minor units
```

Example:

```text
BRL 8.79
→ currency_code = BRL
→ amount_minor = 879
```

The guide may explain money abstractly, but `M` is not the sole stored database unit.

## 16.5 Quantity and dimensional representation

The earlier broad `m` symbol is rejected as the sole stored measure because equal numeric magnitudes across mass, volume, and count do not mean the same physical quantity. Markei must never infer mass from volume or assume `1 L = 1 kg`.

Planning representation:

```text
measurement_kind
    MASS | VOLUME | COUNT

measurement_unit
    KG | L | UNIT

normalized_amount
    fixed precision with three displayed decimals
```

Examples:

```text
350 g
→ 0.350 KG
→ MASS

1 litre
→ 1.000 L
→ VOLUME

5 units
→ 5.000 UNIT
→ COUNT
```

The abstract `m` notation may appear in an explanatory guide only when paired with the explicit dimension/unit. The database and contracts store explicit dimensions.

Package amount and purchased amount remain distinct:

```text
Product:
    package_amount = 0.350 KG

Purchase Item:
    package_count = 2
    purchased_amount = 0.700 KG
```

## 16.6 Price facts and analytics basis

Candidate authoritative purchase-item price facts:

```text
currency code
line total in minor units
package count
normalized purchased amount and unit
promotion observation
```

Candidate derived analytics:

```text
package price
normalized measure price
price change
normalized price change
personal inflation/deflation indicators
store comparisons
forecasts
```

Raw purchase facts remain authoritative.

## 16.7 Versioned analytics boundary

A dedicated TypeScript analytics boundary is accepted as planning direction.

Initial form may be:

```text
analytics.ts
    registry of pure, versioned analytical algorithms
```

Rules:

- each analytic has a stable identifier and version;
- once used for reproducible results, a version's meaning is not changed;
- improved formulas receive a new version;
- services/use cases select the relevant analytic by identifier;
- persisted or cached analytical results record the version used when necessary;
- raw purchase facts are never rewritten by analytical evolution;
- Git history preserves source chronology;
- semantic growth may later split `analytics.ts` into an `analytics/` directory.

This is not authorization to create the file yet.

## 16.8 Synchronization semantics accepted for planning

The first protocol should use:

```text
event UUID
    duplicate protection and retry identity

device UUID + monotonic device sequence
    creation order for one installation

client occurrence timestamp
    business time, not global synchronization order

opaque account-scoped server cursor
    ordered incremental download position
```

Planning policies:

- a sequence gap is rejected and the missing earlier event is requested;
- identical retry under the same event UUID returns the prior acceptance;
- different content under an accepted event UUID is rejected;
- a second device bootstraps from cursor zero in bounded pages;
- one purchase event is atomic and includes its purchase-item lines;
- an upload request may contain several purchase events and return per-event transactional results;
- API authorization is mandatory;
- database row-level security remains a defense-in-depth evaluation;
- general edit/delete conflict resolution remains deferred.

## 16.9 TypeScript exploration direction

TypeScript is accepted as the primary language for the next shared-client/API exploration.

This does not authorize a hybrid Python/TypeScript runtime inside the new client.

Planning boundary:

```text
accepted PySide6 beta
    preserved as reference, fixture source, and rollback

new shared client
    TypeScript-oriented candidate

custom synchronization API
    TypeScript favored for first comparison/protocol harness

Python ↔ TypeScript continuity
    specifications
    deterministic fixtures
    expected behavior
    migration evidence

not
    embedded Python runtime or client IPC bridge
```

Reasons:

- a Python/TypeScript installed-client bridge would add two runtimes, serialization, lifecycle coordination, cross-language debugging, and multi-platform packaging;
- language-neutral contracts and fixtures allow gradual semantic replacement without embedding the desktop runtime;
- TypeScript can serve client, protocol types, runtime validation, API, tests, and analytics while preserving clear boundaries.

Primary client-family comparison:

```text
Tauri 2 + TypeScript frontend
versus
React Native + React Native Windows
```

Flutter remains the non-TypeScript control candidate. Capacitor remains secondary because Windows desktop is not its primary official target.

No framework is accepted yet. The next empirical comparison must measure local SQLite support, secure token storage, Windows/Android/iOS lifecycle, packaging, accessibility, testing, native integration, and maintenance cost.

## 16.10 Current decision state

```text
catalogue identity: provisionally defined
purchase aggregate: provisionally defined
historical identity policy: provisionally defined
currency storage: provisionally defined
quantity dimensions: provisionally defined
analytics versioning: provisionally defined
sync ordering/idempotency: provisionally defined
TypeScript exploration: accepted
embedded Python bridge: rejected as primary architecture
Tauri vs React Native Windows: open
auth provider: open
exact API runtime/host: open
physical schema: not materialized
implementation: not authorized
D/E/F: postponed
```

The next action is domain-memory reconciliation and Didactic KANBAN promotion, followed by Main-root continuity refresh. Framework or schema implementation requires a later explicit authorization.
