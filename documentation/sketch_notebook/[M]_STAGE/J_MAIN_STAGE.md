## 1. Reconciliation

R04B proved Docker/PostgreSQL availability and added an inert barrier interface, phase names, several
reach points and containment tests. Git later published that partial work as fab9357.

R04B did not add:

- an active lab barrier controller;
- participant-aware reach/release coordination;
- an Account state observer;
- case-addressable authorization scenarios;
- producer completion or R04 aggregation.

Source inspection also found:

- enrollment reaches before-protected-mutation after earlier durable writes;
- before-commit is a generic database callback without operation/participant context.

Therefore:

~~~text
C10-MCG02-R04B_PARTIAL
AUTHORIZATION_RACE_PRODUCER=false
R3_LOCAL_SECURITY_PROVED=false
~~~

## 2. Strategy correction

The previous unit was too broad. R04 is now decomposed into independently successful slices:

~~~text
R04C01  proof infrastructure + one membership-denial slice
R04C02  identity, membership and actor-Device route matrix
R04C03  target Device and enrollment concurrency
R04C04  response loss, restart, retry exhaustion and final R04 aggregate
R05      complete Flutter HTTP/file-backed proof and global local aggregate
MCG-02   human/provider Auth0 + Neon + Render proof
Promotion and Main Cycle 10 closure
~~~

Only R04C01 is active.

## 3. R04C01 objective

Build reusable proof infrastructure and prove one complete scenario:

~~~text
working deterministic barrier controller
+ corrected transaction phase placement
+ canonical Account state observer
+ membership-disabled-before-fence upload denial
~~~

The authorization producer remains false after this unit. That is expected and does not make
R04C01 partial.

## 4. Reusable infrastructure

R04C01 selects:

- a participant-aware lab barrier controller;
- context-aware transaction lifecycle signaling;
- canonical payload-free Account snapshots;
- a reusable arrange/snapshot/pause/intervene/release/compare scenario runner;
- deterministic cleanup and safe ScenarioResult output.

Later R04 and recovery/synchronization assays should add scenarios to these mechanisms rather than
rebuild them.

## 5. Phase corrections

Required meanings:

| Phase | Placement |
| --- | --- |
| before-identity-membership-fence | inside transaction, before current identity/membership resolution |
| after-membership-lock | only after relevant identity/membership rows are actually locked |
| before-actor-device-lock | immediately before actor Device FOR UPDATE |
| before-target-transition | after authorization/locks, immediately before transition |
| before-protected-mutation | immediately before the first durable write |
| before-commit | after writes and before COMMIT, with operation/participant context |

R04C01 must correct enrollment placement and remove or replace context-free before-commit behavior.

## 6. Representative scenario

Use membership-disabled-before-fence on a valid upload:

1. seed an active identity, membership and Device;
2. prepare a valid purchase submission;
3. capture Account state;
4. pause upload before membership resolution;
5. disable membership from a control transaction;
6. commit the control transition;
7. release upload;
8. require typed 403 authorization denial;
9. capture Account state again;
10. prove protected synchronization state did not advance.

The membership status transition itself is expected. Facts, submissions, events, cursors,
acknowledgements, recovery state, Devices and security-event state must otherwise remain unchanged.

## 7. R04C01 terminal

Success:

~~~text
R04C01_BARRIER_CONTROLLER=true
R04C01_ACCOUNT_OBSERVER=true
R04C01_MEMBERSHIP_DENIAL_SLICE=true
AUTHORIZATION_RACE_PRODUCER=false
R04_REMAINING_CASES_PENDING
C10-MCG02-R04C01_PROVED
~~~

Do not mark denied-no-state-advance globally true. It remains pending until the wider matrix covers
all required state families.

## 8. Validation boundary

R04C01 validates:

- Docker/PostgreSQL preflight;
- barrier controller lifecycle and timeout tests;
- phase-placement tests;
- Account snapshot canonicalization;
- real Fastify/PostgreSQL representative scenario;
- complete server format/lint/typecheck/tests/build;
- diff, secret and teardown checks.

Full Flutter builds, all proof producers and global aggregation return in R04C04/R05 unless a shared
contract changed.

## 9. Scope boundary

R04C01 excludes:

- the other 27 authorization cases;
- provider access or credentials;
- migrations, dependencies, lockfiles and Drift changes;
- Flutter R05 work;
- UI, MCG-03, MCG-04, deployment and permanent promotion.

Production correction requires a retained failing vertical-slice test and must remain narrow.

## 10. Forward coordination

After R04C01 reconciliation:

- R04C02 reuses the controller/observer for identity, membership and actor Device cases;
- R04C03 reuses them for target and enrollment concurrency;
- R04C04 adds response-loss/restart/retry evidence and runs the full authorization aggregate;
- R05 proves the complete Flutter transport/file-backed boundary;
- human MCG-02 proves provider configuration;
- functional domains promote accepted evidence;
- Main closes Cycle 10 only after all named gates reconcile.

No later unit is automatically authorized by R04C01 completion.

## 11. Append-only reconciliation — R04C01 result

> Reconciliation marker: C10-MCG02-R04C02_20260717T151546Z

R04C01 is accepted as validated local evidence within its declared boundary.

Evidence reconciled:

- the remote implementation is a direct child of the controlling D/E/F commit;
- the participant-aware controller, Account observer and reusable scenario runner exist;
- enrollment protected-mutation and target-transition placement were corrected;
- the real upload scenario records a typed 403 after a committed membership disable;
- protected Account synchronization state remains unchanged except for the expected membership
  transition;
- Codex recorded 8 focused tests and 45 total server tests passing;
- Main independently reran format, lint, typecheck, all 45 server tests, build and production audit;
- `git diff --check` passed and the commit changed only the authorized server/proof/report paths.

Main could not independently rerun Docker because Docker is unavailable in the reconciliation
environment. The committed scenario and the recorded Windows/Docker PostgreSQL 18.4 run remain the
environment-scoped evidence for the real database case.

R04C01 terminal accepted:

~~~text

C10-MCG02-R04C01_PROVED
~~~

## 12. Evidence corrections retained

G/H/I contain two report-header defects:

1. their controlling D/E/F SHA repeats the J SHA; the correct D/E/F SHA is `2f7272a8...`;
2. their implementation tree and final commit fields remained `pending`; Git resolves them to tree
   `0740d103...` and commit `40e0a70...`.

These are observational metadata corrections. They do not invalidate the executed tests or source
evidence. Codex must resolve commit/tree fields accurately in the next G/H/I reports.

## 13. Phase-scheme revision

The earlier forward scheme is preserved above as history. Current coordination merges the former
R04C02 and R04C03 because R04C01 proved their shared controller, observer, fixture and scenario
foundation. R04C04 remains separate because transport loss, process restart and deterministic retry
exhaustion require materially different mechanisms.

Current scheme:

~~~text
R04C01  reusable proof infrastructure + membership-disabled slice       VALIDATED
R04C02  core authorization matrix: identity/member/actor/target/enroll  ACTIVE
R04C04  response loss + restart + retry exhaustion + final R04 aggregate PENDING
R05      Flutter HTTP/file-backed proof + global local aggregate          PENDING
MCG-02   human Auth0 + Neon + Render proof                                PENDING
Promotion and Main Cycle 10 closure                                       PENDING
~~~

R04C02 uses three internal checkpoints:

~~~text
CP-A  identity, membership and actor-Device race cases
CP-B  target authorization, revoke concurrency and later actor denial
CP-C  equivalent/conflicting enrollment concurrency
~~~

The unit may be one commit, but each checkpoint must produce case-addressable results before the
next begins. A failed checkpoint remains diagnosable and cannot be converted into inherited truth.

## 14. R04C02 acceptance boundary

R04C02 must execute cases 2–24 of the existing authorization producer while retaining the validated
case 1. It may then report 24 true cases and exactly four pending cases:

- response-loss-query-replay;
- process-restart-replay;
- serialization-retry-exhaustion-fails-closed;
- denied-no-state-advance.

`AUTHORIZATION_RACE_PRODUCER` remains false until R04C04. R04C02 success is therefore a bounded
matrix checkpoint, not local-security or provider completion.

## 15. Forward authority

D/E/F carrying marker `C10-MCG02-R04C02_20260717T151546Z` are the only active Codex authority.
R04C04, R05, provider mutation, permanent promotion and Cycle 10 closure remain unauthorized.

R04C02 is accepted as validated local evidence within its declared boundary.

Evidence reconciled:

- the implementation is a direct child of the controlling staging commit;
- all 24 core cases are produced from structured scenario results;
- actor-denial cases use real protected routes and valid route-specific fixtures;
- target authorization, one-transition/one-event revoke truth and enrollment convergence are
  represented by committed scenario code;
- one retained failing Device-management scenario justified a narrow barrier-placement correction;
- Codex recorded CP-A/B/C passing, 46 server tests, build, audit and clean teardown;
- Main independently reran format, lint, typecheck, 46/46 tests, build and production audit;
- `git diff --check` passed and only authorized server/proof/report paths changed.

Main could not rerun Docker in the reconciliation environment. The committed scenarios and recorded
Windows/Docker/PostgreSQL 18.4 execution remain the environment-scoped database evidence.

## 17. Reconciliation qualifications

G/H/I again left implementation tree and commit fields pending. Git resolves them above. Future
reports must distinguish authoring-time pending metadata from Main-resolved final metadata.

`authorization_slice_scenarios.ts` grew to 1,669 lines. This does not invalidate R04C02, but it is a
recovery and maintenance liability. R04C04 must split scenario infrastructure by responsibility
before adding its three mechanisms. The refactor must preserve behavior and pass the existing 24
cases before new case work begins.

## 18. Current phase scheme

~~~text
R04C01  reusable proof infrastructure + first denial slice               VALIDATED

~~~

R04C04 has four ordered checkpoints:

~~~text
CP-0  split oversized scenario module without semantic change
CP-1  response-loss query replay and process-restart replay
CP-2  deterministic serialization retry exhaustion with no state advance
CP-3  derive global denied-no-state-advance and run final R04 aggregation
~~~

## 19. R04C04 acceptance boundary

R04C04 must make the remaining four authorization cases true from executed evidence, then make the
authorization producer true. The R04 orchestrator must accept migration, JWKS, route, static and
authorization producers as true while Flutter remains validly false only for `not-yet-r05`.

Success proves the server-side R04 authorization boundary. It does not prove Flutter transport,
provider configuration, production deployment, full MCG-02 or Cycle 10 closure.

## 20. Forward authority

D/E/F carrying marker `C10-MCG02-R04C04_20260717T154951Z` are the only active Codex authority.
R05, providers, permanent promotion, MCG-03/04 and Cycle 10 closure remain unauthorized.

R04C04 completed the behavioral proof:

- response-loss query replay recovered one committed enrollment result;
- process-restart replay recovered the same PostgreSQL truth in a new composition;
- retry exhaustion recorded three bounded attempts and zero durable protected advance;
- denied-no-state-advance was derived from a closed executed denial set;
- all 28 authorization cases and the authorization producer passed;
- the R04 orchestrator reported proof-pipeline integrity true with Flutter false only for R05.

Codex recorded Docker/PostgreSQL 18.4 execution, clean teardown, all server checks and producer runs.
Main independently reran format, lint, typecheck, 46/46 server tests, build and audit. Docker was not
available in Main's environment, so real producer/orchestrator execution remains Codex's recorded
environment-scoped evidence.

## 22. Structural observation and disposition

`authorization_slice_scenarios.ts` grew to 1,936 lines. Length alone is not drift or a failed gate:
the module still compiles, passes its tests and produces the required closed evidence. Main therefore
does not insert a mandatory mid-phase solely to reduce line count.

The scenario-module split is recorded as Cycle 10 pruning work. It should occur after the decisive
R05 proof, when the complete proof topology can be reorganized without repeatedly moving an active
boundary. This disposition supersedes the unmaterialized CP-0 preference without weakening R04's
behavioral result.

## 24. R05 acceptance boundary

R05 must make all 16 `flutter-http-file-backed` cases true through real Flutter transport,
file-backed Drift and loopback hosted API evidence. It must preserve local facts/outbox across every
failure and unknown outcome, prove one absolute request deadline and client ownership, and prove
that bearer tokens are ephemeral and absent from durable state/log output.

After the Flutter producer passes, the global aggregator must accept all six producers and report
`R3_LOCAL_SECURITY_PROVED=true`. Provider acceptance remains a separate human MCG-02 gate.

R05 completed the local Flutter and global proof boundary:

- all 16 `flutter-http-file-backed` cases passed from closed case records;
- real Flutter HTTP transport and file-backed Drift preserved facts and pending outbox state;
- response-loss replay, process-safe query replay, absolute deadline and client ownership passed;
- bearer-token material was absent from the inspected Drift bytes and retained diagnostic state;
- the Flutter producer and all five earlier producers passed the strict global aggregator;
- the final orchestrator reported proof-pipeline integrity and local R3 security true;
- Flutter analysis/tests, Android debug, Windows release and server validation passed in Codex's
  recorded environment; Docker/PostgreSQL resources were torn down.

Main inspected the final Git tree, reports and strict producer/orchestrator implementation. The
commit changes only proof infrastructure, one Flutter proof test and G/H/I; it does not mutate
production provider configuration, migrations, dependencies, UI or permanent memory. `git diff
--check` passed. Main's attempted independent npm reinstall was inconclusive because the execution
environment could not create its npm cache and returned corrupted-download warnings; this is an
environment limitation, not contrary behavioral evidence.

## 27. Phase decision

The next phase is not MCG-03. Permanent memory still defines MCG-03 and MCG-04 as undefined and
inactive. R05 proves local readiness only; it does not prove Auth0, Neon, Render or deployment.

The remaining ordered work is:

~~~text

MCG-02 human Auth0 + Neon + Render provider proof                   NEXT

MCG-03 / MCG-04 definition…3926 tokens truncated…pected implementation: df904fb plus staged hosted-binding authority at 65ae6a7
> Current status: **AUTH0 LOGIN VALIDATED; NATIVE CREDENTIAL ACCEPTANCE CORRECTION ACTIVE**

Human provider evidence established more than the earlier host exclusion:

- Windows Developer Mode and the release-build toolchain are available;
- the configured release executable built successfully with Auth0 Flutter 2.4.0;
- cpprestsdk, OpenSSL, Boost and Zlib were resolved through a pinned local vcpkg registry;
- the development closure surface became available only with explicit compile-time configuration;
- the `auth0flutter` callback allowlist and current-user protocol registration were exercised;
- the Auth0 Windows application is Native, uses Authorization Code plus PKCE, has no Client
  Credentials grant and has user-delegated access to the Markei API;
- signup, email verification and user login are recorded as successful in sanitized Auth0 logs.

The client nevertheless returns `authentication-rejected` after the successful provider login.
Device enrollment and hosted synchronization were therefore not executed. This contradicts native
credential acceptance, not provider identity verification or the Windows release build.

## 47. Selected narrow correction

Codex must first make the post-login boundary diagnosable and correct:

~~~text
successful Auth0 login
-> consent/authorization result
-> auth0flutter callback activation
-> secondary-instance forwarding
-> waiting SDK transaction
-> authorization-code exchange
-> credential validation
-> authenticated
~~~

The correction must preserve bounded, non-secret failure categories; align the Windows runner with
the pinned SDK's callback contract; prove that the waiting transaction consumes the callback; and
reject malformed, duplicate, stale or cross-transaction callbacks without exposing tokens, codes,
PKCE material, state, nonce, identity or complete URLs.

The hosted Account/Device binding selected in sections 43–45 remains accepted as the next source
unit, but it is temporarily blocked: enrollment cannot begin until native credentials reach the
truthful `authenticated` state. No provider mutation, enrollment or synchronization is authorized
inside this correction.

## 48. Revised phase projection and authority

~~~text
MCG-02 provider foundation and Auth0 user login                     VALIDATED
MCG-02 Windows release build and protocol dispatch                  VALIDATED

D/E/F carrying marker `C10-MCG02-WINDOWS-AUTH-CALLBACK_20260719T011836Z` are the only active Codex
authority. They supersede the hosted-binding D/E/F for execution order without rejecting that
design. Success reopens the hosted-binding unit; it does not close MCG-02.

## 49. Append-only reconciliation — authenticated Windows provider proof

> Reconciliation marker: C10-MCG02-WINDOWS-RUNTIME-PACKAGING_20260719T155742Z
> Reconciled at UTC: 2026-07-19T15:57:42Z

> Inspected implementation: 1922ffc38b9a7b24cf49143e9fae726f9f8349db
> Current status: **AUTHENTICATION VALIDATED; REPRODUCIBLE RUNTIME PACKAGING ACTIVE**

Sanitized human evidence after `1922ffc` confirms Windows release build, closure-surface launch,
Auth0 signup/login, protocol callback consumption, authorization-code exchange, credential
acceptance, stable authenticated status, logout and re-sign-in. No token, callback, identity or
provider secret is retained in staging.

The decisive diagnostic was runtime deployment. Direct/session-assisted launch could find vcpkg
libraries through a temporary PATH, while the browser-launched callback process reported missing
`cpprest_2_10.dll`. Copying the vcpkg release runtime DLLs beside `markei.exe` made authentication,
logout and re-sign-in pass. The source authentication correction is therefore accepted; the manual
copy is not an acceptable distributable result.

## 50. Selected closure step 1

Codex must make Windows Debug and Release outputs carry their configuration-correct runtime closure
after `flutter clean`, without PATH mutation, manual copies, committed binaries or machine-specific
paths. Clean direct and callback-process launch are distinct gates. Real Auth0 login remains a
subsequent human retest after the packaging correction is published.

~~~text

~~~

D/E/F carrying marker `C10-MCG02-WINDOWS-RUNTIME-PACKAGING_20260719T155742Z` are the only active
Codex authority. Success authorizes a clean human authentication retest; it does not authorize
Enroll, Sync, provider mutation, MCG-02 closure or MCG-03.

## 51. Fresh-chat continuity handoff

> Continuity marker: C10-MCG02-04-CLOSURE-HANDOFF_20260720T120703Z
> Recorded at UTC: 2026-07-20T12:07:03Z

> Status: **READ-ONLY CONTINUITY; CURRENT HUMAN GATE UNCHANGED**

This section supports a fresh Main chat and does not promote evidence or replace D/E/F. After the
canonical methodology boot, the new chat must read J through this section, then current D/E/F and
G/H/I together. It must retain the following exact execution order:

~~~text
1. clean Windows provider authentication retest without PATH/manual DLL copying
2. Main reconciliation of that sanitized human evidence
3. restage hosted Account/Device binding and Account/Device-scoped synchronization
4. Codex implementation and local decisive proof
5. controlled provider membership and two distinct Device enrollments
6. Windows + Android hosted synchronization/convergence and negative authorization proof
7. MCG-02 reconciliation, permanent-domain promotion and closure
8. Main definition/staging of MCG-03
9. MCG-03 evidence/reconciliation before MCG-04 activation
10. MCG-04 evidence/reconciliation and Cycle 10 closure
~~~

The current executable authority remains D/E/F marker
`C10-MCG02-WINDOWS-RUNTIME-PACKAGING_20260719T155742Z`. Codex reports at `734c559` support
`MCG-02_WINDOWS_RUNTIME_PACKAGING_CORRECTED` and require a clean human provider retest. Until that
retest is recorded, **Enroll**, **Query**, **Sync**, provider membership mutation, hosted-binding
implementation, MCG-03 and MCG-04 remain unauthorized.

The fresh chat must not infer the content of MCG-03 or MCG-04 from their labels. Their objectives,
provider boundaries, data effects, tests and terminal conditions require new Main reconciliation
after MCG-02 closes. Any provider-dependent action must be presented as a gated human procedure;
credentials, tokens, complete callback URLs, identity subjects and database connection strings stay
outside Git, chat and staging.

## 52. Append-only reconciliation — hosted binding execution resumed

> Current status: **LOCAL HOSTED-BINDING CORRECTION ACTIVE; PROVIDER RETEST PENDING**

The clean remote history and current source confirm the unresolved mismatch from sections 43–45:
application composition boots with `local-account` and a local Device, enrollment stores different
hosted Account/server Device identifiers, and hosted sync constructs unscoped outbox/applier
adapters. Provider synchronization must not proceed in that state.

Codex's packaging evidence at `734c559` is accepted for automated purposes. A fresh human Auth0
retest from that exact clean artifact is not available as reconciled evidence and remains
provenance-unresolved. Main now reorders two independent gates: the provider retest remains pending,
while the local-only binding/scoping correction may proceed because it needs no credentials,
provider access or remote mutation.

## 53. Selected implementation unit

The restarted composition must validate the durable hosted binding and select its hosted AccountId
and server DeviceId for new hosted facts. The enrolling process reports `hosted-restart-required`
and cannot sync. Hosted outbox, unknown replay, inbox, cursor, fact application and acknowledgement
must be explicitly scoped. Existing local-only facts/events remain immutable, pending and excluded.

The decisive proof uses file-backed Drift, real loopback HTTP/server authorization and two isolated
Devices. It must demonstrate restart activation, exact envelope identities, preserved local-only
work, cross-Account atomic rejection, scoped acknowledgement, close/reopen persistence and
two-Device convergence. It may not weaken server checks or substitute direct event injection.

## 54. Revised phase projection and authority

## 55. Append-only reconciliation — hosted binding and native authentication

> Reconciliation marker: C10-MCG02-PROVIDER-CONVERGENCE_20260720T175006Z
> Reconciled at UTC: 2026-07-20T17:50:06Z
> Reconciled at America/Sao_Paulo: 2026-07-20T14:50:06-03:00

> Status: **LOCAL HOSTED BINDING VALIDATED; NATIVE AUTH VALIDATED; PROVIDER CONVERGENCE ACTIVE**

### Claim: hosted Account/Device binding is locally validated

Prior state: active local implementation unit. Evidence: G/H/I at `e762b64` record 93 Flutter
tests with two expected lab skips, 46 API tests, Android debug and Windows release builds, nine
focused hosted tests, file-backed restart/scoping evidence and disposable Docker/PostgreSQL
`CONVERGED=true`. The implementation selects a validated binding after restart, scopes hosted
outbox/replay/cursor/applier/acknowledgement, rejects cross-Account pages atomically and preserves
local-only pending work. Resulting state: accepted local/provider-ready implementation, not provider
acceptance.

### Claim: Windows and Android native authentication are human-validated

Prior state: Windows validated; Android pending. Sanitized human evidence now confirms Android
emulator build/install, Auth0 allowlist correction, provider login, callback return and authenticated
state. The earlier callback `Not found` resulted from supplying the Auth0 domain to Dart but not the
Android Gradle manifest placeholder; setting the process-local
`ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_MARKEI_AUTH0_DOMAIN`, rebuilding and using the exact callback resolved it. A
separate Flutter debug-service WebSocket failure was bypassed by the release proof and is not an
authentication failure. Resulting state: native authentication validated on both clients within the
development provider boundary.

## 56. Selected decisive provider unit

Main now authorizes one human-operated development-provider sequence:

~~~text
explicit synthetic identity membership
-> Windows Device A enrollment and restart
-> purchase A hosted sync
-> Android Device B enrollment and restart
-> bidirectional A/B convergence and reopen
-> Device B revocation denial
-> development API outage continuity and recovery
-> logout/token ephemerality
-> sanitized Neon counts and Render log scan
~~~

The provider proof must stop on ambiguous identity mapping, missing restart boundary, cross-Account
data, local-only event selection, unexpected provider activity or secret exposure. Codex receives no
credentials and may diagnose only redacted evidence.

## 57. Revised projection and authority

## 58. Append-only interruption — hosted Purchase registration correction

> Reconciliation marker: C10-MCG02-HOSTED-PURCHASE-CORRECTION_20260720T193745Z
> Reconciled at UTC: 2026-07-20T19:37:45Z
> Authority baseline: a3d2c782584054fdd53a71a90aab0d8ead78e12f
> Status: **BOUNDED CODEX CORRECTION ACTIVE; PROVIDER CONVERGENCE PAUSED**

Human evidence advanced the provider sequence through exact Auth0-subject correction, active owner
membership, Windows Device A enrollment and the required restart boundary. The restarted client
then failed to register synthetic Purchase A locally. Drift rolled the transaction back and the UI
preserved the in-memory draft, but `PurchasePage` suppressed the underlying exception behind a
generic message. Catalogue exposes Product management while Store creation exists only as an
implicit Purchase field. This blocks the first hosted event and therefore every later convergence
claim.

Main selects one local-only correction: reproduce and fix hosted-bound Purchase registration,
surface bounded typed diagnostics, and add explicit Account-scoped Store creation as a Catalogue
section separate from Products. Purchase registration must select an existing Store and remain
atomic. Existing enrollment, binding, local-only facts, payload v3 and provider configuration are
preserved.

## 60. Append-only reconciliation — Store selection remains blocked

> Reconciliation marker: C10-MCG02-STORE-SELECTION-CORRECTION_20260720T201904Z
> Reconciled at UTC: 2026-07-20T20:19:04Z
> Implementation evidence: bf78a3908ad05b3e7a0decc197fa2f99970059f1
> Status: **STORE CREATION VALIDATED LOCAL; PURCHASE SELECTION CORRECTION ACTIVE**

G/H/I at `bf78a39` support the local repository correction: explicit Catalogue Store creation,
Account-scoped listing, typed diagnostics, hosted-bound registration tests, exact event/outbox
counts and supported platform builds passed. Human provider retest confirms Store creation is
visible, but the Purchase Store control does not provide a reliable explicit selection contract.
It silently defaults to the first `Store` object and binds the widget value by object instance;
refresh and navigation reconstruct Store objects. The screenshot displays a Store label but does
not prove a stable StoreId was selected for the command. Purchase A remains blocked.

Main selects a UI/application correction, not a data-model change: bind selection by stable StoreId,
require an explicit choice, visibly confirm the selected Store, preserve it by ID across refresh,
and prove the complete Catalogue-create -> Purchase-select -> Product-stage -> register flow. Codex
must reproduce the human symptom before choosing the final fix; object-instance drift is a working
hypothesis, not promoted fact.

## 62. Append-only reconciliation — persistent Purchase transaction failure

> Reconciliation marker: C10-MCG02-PURCHASE-TRANSACTION-DIAGNOSTIC_20260720T205714Z
> Reconciled at UTC: 2026-07-20T20:57:14Z
> Implementation evidence: bf824cea0648202cf9e04ad98553239c00dab6e0
> Status: **SELECTION VALIDATED HUMAN; TRANSACTION DIAGNOSTIC ACTIVE**

G/H/I at `bf824ce` validate explicit StoreId selection, refresh persistence and the synthetic
Catalogue-to-Purchase fixture. Human retest confirms the Store is explicitly selected and visibly
confirmed, the Product Item is staged, registration reports `purchase-registration-unknown`, and
Purchase A is absent from History. The registration transaction therefore failed and rolled back;
this is not a Store-selection or post-commit refresh failure.

The fresh hosted fixture did not reproduce the long-lived Windows database failure. Main selects a
diagnostic-first unit: classify every registration phase with safe codes, reproduce a migrated
file-backed local-to-hosted lifecycle, and fix only an evidenced cause. The human database, Device A
binding, Catalogue facts and provider state must not be reset, copied into Git or supplied to Codex.

## 64. Append-only reconciliation — malformed migrated foreign keys reproduced

> Reconciliation marker: C10-MCG02-DRIFT-V8-FK-REPAIR_20260720T221440Z
> Reconciled at UTC: 2026-07-20T22:14:40Z
> Diagnostic evidence: 00c78e85c19f4acdc5554fb695c181af10616bc0
> Status: **ROOT CAUSE REPRODUCED; FORWARD REPAIR ACTIVE**

G/H/I at `00c78e8` reproduce the human symptom in a file-backed v2-to-v7 hosted lifecycle and
localize the first failure to `insert-purchase`. SQLite metadata shows migrated `purchases` foreign
keys still naming dropped `people_old` and `payment_methods_old`, and `purchase_items` still naming
dropped `products_old`. Registration is not applied: existing History, events, outbox, cursor,
Device sequence and hosted binding remain unchanged. Safe phase diagnostics and all ordinary tests
and supported builds pass.

The diagnostic result is accepted as partial, not promoted as a correction. Main now authorizes a
forward-only Drift schema v8 repair for installed v7 databases. It must rebuild the affected tables,
preserve all valid rows and synchronization/identity state, pass foreign-key validation, survive
reopen, and register one atomic Purchase through the production path. Editing the human database,
resetting it, or manually deleting facts is forbidden.

## 66. Append-only reconciliation — hosted outbox rejected before application

> Reconciliation marker: C10-MCG02-ORDERED-OUTBOX-RECOVERY_20260721T000323Z
> Reconciled at UTC: 2026-07-21T00:03:23Z
> Implementation evidence: 7e65d310260deeec7391915e5d3546a35b8dadb2
> Human evidence: sanitized Windows local aggregates + Neon aggregates
> Status: **V8 VALIDATED HUMAN; ORDERED OUTBOX RECOVERY ACTIVE**

The human Windows database opened at schema v8, preserved History and locally committed two hosted
Purchases. Its hosted Device owns two immutable, hash-valid, Account/Device-valid events at
contiguous sequences `1,2` and local next sequence `3`. Six older local-only Device events remain
correctly outside hosted scope. Neon contains one active enrolled Device expecting sequence `1` and
zero submissions/events/acknowledgements. The local attempt is `failed/notApplied/conflict`.

Provider health, authentication and enrollment pass. Repository inspection shows pending selection
and subsequent event hydration do not define Device-sequence order, while the server validates each
event against the next expected sequence and Flutter collapses unrecognized failures—including
`sequence-gap`—to generic conflict. Reversed batch order explains all current evidence but remains a
high-confidence hypothesis until a deterministic test reproduces it.

Main authorizes one local-first correction: explicit canonical outbox ordering, contiguous-batch
preflight, preservation of bounded server failure codes, and a one-time explicit recovery path for
definitely-not-applied legacy failed submissions. Immutable events, sequences, human databases and
provider rows must not be edited.

## 68. Append-only reconciliation — ordered upload proved; production recovery unwired

> Implementation evidence: bbb5922b8afa5ab85646c34b9cd08e0c24fcf48a
> Status: **ORDERED UPLOAD PROVED; RECOVERY ORCHESTRATION ACTIVE**

G/H/I and source inspection accept the ordered-outbox correction. A deterministic file-backed test
reproduces reversed hydration, canonical leasing transmits `1,2`, the real HTTP/PostgreSQL proof
advances the server from `1` to `3`, replay is idempotent, recognized failure codes remain typed,
and all reported Flutter/API tests and supported platform builds pass.

The unit is implemented and locally validated, but human recovery is not yet executable through the
product path. `recoverFailedNotApplied(submissionId)` has repository tests but no production caller;
the application coordinator cannot discover or recover the existing failed Windows attempt. Main
therefore withholds provider retest and authorizes one narrow orchestration-wiring unit.
