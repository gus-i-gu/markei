# J_MAIN_STAGE — GCM-02 Single-Sync Authorization Reconciliation

> Sequence: FLX-PRM-04 evidence reconciliation and bounded FLX-ORD-01 continuation
> Authority marker: C10-GCM02-SINGLE-SYNC-PREFLIGHT_20260725
> Repository checkpoint: `c76734e32f70702978f5c7a543c1f0ef3c63c521`
> Status: **12.4 PASS; 12.5 NEXT; HUMAN AUTHORIZATION PENDING; SYNC HELD**

## 1. Overall staging reconciliation

Migration 007 is already applied once and its provider postflight is accepted in the append-only
history below. Runtime readiness, Render live/ready behavior, a real Auth0 user token and exact
Account/Device binding have subsequently been exercised through the reviewed GRIMOIRE procedures.
The Windows release build also passed after restoring the terminal-local native toolchain
coordinates; no source change was required for that repair.

The completed evidence narrows the remaining GCM-02 route to one controlled request experiment. It
does not itself authorize that experiment. The governing order is:

```text
provider and identity prerequisites
-> exact read-only pre-request baseline
-> one permitted-transition definition
-> assembled evidence review
-> explicit human authorization
-> exactly one Sync request with no automatic retry
-> HTTP/log/provider-state correlation
-> GCM-02 reconciliation
```

The difficult Auth0 token collection does not need to be repeated unless the token expires before
the final authorized request or a later check specifically requires a fresh token.

## 2. Current gate ledger

| Gate | Reconciled status | Evidence boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 12.1 Render live/ready | **PASS** | `GS-HOST-01` returned live and ready HTTP 200 for the reconciled deployment |
| 12.2 Auth0 public metadata | **PASS** | issuer, audience, RS256 algorithm, subject presence and token time window all matched |
| 12.3 Git, API and deployed-revision alignment | **PASS at inspected checkpoint** | operator evidence reported identical local/remote revision, clean worktree, corrected build/audit, deployed-revision match and repeated host readiness; re-check if branch or deployment changes |
| 12.4 Exact Account/Device/token binding | **PASS** | `GS-AUTH-02`: identity 200, Device 200, token accepted and `exact-binding-confirmed` |
| 12.5 Read-only provider baseline | **NEXT** | exact pre-request six-table/cursor counters and correlation fingerprints are not yet captured in this reconciliation |
| 12.6 Define permitted single transition | **PENDING** | must be derived from the accepted 12.5 baseline; no mutation yet |
| 12.7 Human authorization | **PENDING** | eligible only after 12.5, 12.6 and Main evidence review |
| 12.8 Exactly one Sync request | **HELD** | no automatic retry; no second request |
| 12.9 Post-request comparison | **HELD** | requires HTTP result, correlated Render logs and exact post-request counters |
| 12.10 GCM-02 reconciliation | **HELD** | requires allowlist comparison and trustworthy terminal classification |

The 12.3 pass is checkpoint-scoped. Documentation-only commits after the inspected deployment do not
silently prove a new deployment match; `GRM-GIT-01`, deployed-revision comparison and `GS-HOST-01`
must be repeated if either Git or Render changes before 12.7.

## 3. PRC-01 classification

| Claim | Resulting state and boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Migration 007 is applied once and Account cursor provisioning is present | Validated by prior migrator postflight; do not reapply |
| Runtime readiness-v2 and Render live/ready are usable | Validated at the inspected provider/deployment checkpoint |
| Auth0 public token contract is correct | Validated with one real user access token; token value was not persisted |
| Token subject, fixture Account and active Device belong together | Validated by `GS-AUTH-02` as `exact-binding-confirmed` |
| The exact pre-request provider state is frozen | Not yet accepted; 12.5 remains active |
| The only permitted database transition is defined | Not yet accepted; 12.6 remains pending |
| A Sync request is authorized | Rejected until explicit 12.7 human authorization |
| Deployment/readiness/authentication success proves Sync success | Rejected |
| An automatic retry is permissible after timeout or ambiguity | Rejected |
| GCM-02 is closed | Rejected |

## 4. Preserved safety boundary

Until 12.7 is explicitly granted:

- do not select or invoke Sync;
- do not enroll, re-enroll, Query, repair, resequence or rewrite local events;
- do not mutate Neon, Auth0 or Render configuration;
- do not reapply migration 007;
- do not paste or commit the Auth0 token or fixture Device UUID;
- do not infer a provider transition from logs, health or readiness alone;
- stop if local/remote Git alignment, deployed revision, fixture identity or provider counters differ
  from the accepted checkpoint.

Any token used for the eventual request must remain session-only and fresh enough for its complete
time window. Any uncertain HTTP result remains unknown until provider counters and logs correlate it.

## 5. Decided route to 12.7

### 12.5 — freeze the exact read-only provider baseline

1. Keep Markei closed or paused so no background action can change the baseline.
2. Re-run `GRM-NEON-10` through the runtime identity and require readiness-v2 success.
3. Run sanitized `GRM-NEON-08` Device inventory.
4. Run `GRM-NEON-09` for the exact fixture Device UUID, entered only at the masked local prompt.
5. Capture the exact read-only pre-request counters required by the canonical GRIMOIRE procedure:
   Accounts, Devices, cursor state, submissions, Sync events and acknowledgements, plus the relevant
   cursor/high-water and request-correlation fingerprints.
6. Stop on any unexpected row, duplicate active Device, missing cursor row, identity mismatch,
   readiness failure or unexplained movement.

### 12.6 — define the one permitted transition

From the accepted baseline, state one allowlist before any request. It must name:

- the single permitted endpoint and exact fixture identity;
- the immutable request/event identities and hashes to be reused;
- the maximum allowed increments for submissions, Sync events and acknowledgements;
- the exact permitted cursor movement;
- every table/count that must remain unchanged;
- allowed terminal HTTP/result classes and the stop rule for timeout, conflict, 503 or ambiguity.

The allowlist is a prediction, not evidence. It must not be revised after observing the request merely
to fit the outcome.

### Evidence review and 12.7 — explicit human authorization

Main reviews 12.1–12.6 as one packet. If every checkpoint is coherent, present the exact request,
baseline, allowlist, capture plan and stop conditions to the human. Only an explicit authorization
given after that review activates 12.8. Silence, earlier permission, successful login or successful
health checks do not count.

## 6. Post-authorization route

If and only if 12.7 is granted:

1. obtain or retain one valid real Auth0 user access token without persisting it;
2. send exactly one Sync request with automatic retry disabled;
3. capture the terminal HTTP result and sanitized correlation fingerprint;
4. capture the corresponding Render log window;
5. immediately repeat the exact read-only provider counters;
6. compare every observed transition against the predeclared allowlist;
7. stop on any ambiguity or mismatch and perform no second request;
8. reconcile GCM-02 only from the correlated HTTP, log and provider-state evidence.

## Append-only reconciliation entry — 2026-07-22 — A/B/C cursor-state lifecycle staging

> Sequence: FLX-PRM-04 functional reconciliation → Main synthesis
> Inspected HEAD: `75dc7bed0789d693af93abb3ed15e107fd77433a`
> Inputs: `DEV_STAGE/A_OPERATIONAL.md`, `DEV_STAGE/B_DIDACTIC.md`, `DEV_STAGE/C_DESIGN.md`

> Status: **A/B/C COMPLETE; NEXT CHECK-GATHERING UNIT IDENTIFIED; NO MATERIALIZATION OR PROVIDER AUTHORITY YET**

### Achievements and repository track record retained

The functional reconciliation accepts the following bounded lineage and achievements:

```text
5b364216  transport observability diagnostics
  -> 22261751  protected-submission 500 diagnosis staging
  -> 75dc7bed  missing cursor-state reproduction and fail-closed correction
```

- Windows Closure correlated `/health/live` and `/health/ready` under fingerprint `500a78db`; both
  returned HTTP 200.
- One previously authorized exact-identity retry reached `POST /v1/sync/submissions` under Render
  fingerprint `46e9a131`; Render returned final HTTP 500 while Closure crossed its 1000 ms observation
  boundary without response headers.
- The post-attempt provider snapshot remained Account 1, Device 1, and zero cursor-state,
  submissions, Sync events and acknowledgements; no hosted commit or duplication was evidenced.
- Local synthetic reproduction proved the missing `account_cursor_state` row caused a zero-row update
  followed by the unsafe failure.
- `75dc7be` converts that path to sanitized HTTP 503 `service-unavailable` / `not-applied`, fixes the
  misleading successful status on `request-failed`, and preserves timeout/unknown-outcome semantics.
- API format, lint, typecheck, build and 51 tests passed; Flutter formatting, analysis and 178 tests
  passed with four gated skips; disposable convergence and recovery harnesses passed; Windows release
  and Android debug builds passed; five protected Python checks passed through `unittest`.
- Migrations 001–006, provider state, credentials, human local data and events 1–2 were not modified.

These are implementation and validation claims within their stated local/build boundaries. They do
not prove that the correction is deployed, that cursor state exists in the hosted environment, that
protected Sync succeeds, or that GCM02 is closed.

### Cross-domain reconciliation

Operational stages a three-part evidence route: read-only ownership inventory, Main-authorized local
correction proof, and only later a separately authorized provider verification. It requires fresh and
existing-Account cases, idempotency, concurrency, rollback, first-submission behavior, RLS and
least-privilege evidence.

Didactic preserves the distinctions:

```text
schema permits a row
!= lifecycle creates the row
!= runtime may safely assume the row exists

observed 503 not-applied
!= timeout/no trustworthy response
!= successful Sync
```

No KANBAN maturity or learner status changes are inferred from implementation evidence.

Design provisionally recommends the responsibility boundary:

```text
Account provisioning owns atomic Account + account_cursor_state initialization
Enrollment consumes/verifies the provisioned Account
Sync advances existing cursor state or fails closed
Existing incomplete Accounts use a controlled forward-only repair path
```

Main accepts this as the preferred direction for the next investigation, not yet as permanent canon or
implementation authority. Enrollment repair, first-Sync lazy initialization, re-enrollment, ad hoc
provider SQL and edits to migrations 001–006 remain rejected.

### Provisional physical candidates and unresolved decision

The next unit must inspect and prove the narrowest enforcement mechanism before Main freezes it:

1. preferred candidate: additive post-006 migration with database-enforced future Account
   initialization plus idempotent existing-Account backfill;
2. enforcement alternative: a narrowly owned Account-insert trigger;
3. acceptable only if comprehensively exclusive: a provisioning procedure with all direct Account
   inserts revoked or removed.

Repair must preserve existing cursor rows and derive a missing row's `next_cursor` from the Account's
immutable hosted high-water (`max(server_cursor) + 1`, or 1 when no events exist). The next unit must
prove locking, concurrency, rollback, safe ownership/search path, ACL/RLS, runtime denial, fresh and
upgrade paths, and first-submission monotonicity. These are staged design requirements, not authority
to create migration 007 yet.

### Next staging boundary

The next provisional unit name is:

```text
C10-MCG02-ACCOUNT-CURSOR-PROVISIONING-REPAIR
```

Before D/E/F become active, Main must use the A/B/C evidence to freeze:

1. trigger-backed invariant versus exclusive provisioning procedure;
2. additive migration identity/checksum policy after 006, if the inventory confirms migration need;
3. high-water repair query and lock/transaction strategy;
4. exact producer matrix and ACL/RLS/object-shadowing probes;
5. separation between local materialization, later deployment, provider repair verification, and the
   still-later exact-identity retry gate.

### Active stop and continuation gate

No permanent Operational, Didactic or Design files are edited by this reconciliation. No D/E/F unit is
activated in this entry. No deployment, migration application, Neon mutation, Auth0/Render change,
enrollment, ordinary Sync or unresolved-submission retry is authorized.

## Append-only reconciliation entry — 2026-07-22 — cursor provisioning mechanism frozen

> Remote checkpoint: `80935f1c312484d0819e119553a11691ec2216b4`

> Status: **D/E/F ACTIVE FOR LOCAL MATERIALIZATION; PROVIDER AND REAL SYNC BLOCKED**

### Remote and methodological track record

The A/B/C/J staging checkpoint was published on `intermid-cycle-recovery` as `80935f1c`. It contains
only functional/Main staging and leaves permanent domain memory unchanged. The branch lineage now
retained for this decision is:

```text
5b364216  transport observability
-> 22261751  submission-500 diagnosis authority
-> 75dc7bed  missing-state reproduction and fail-closed correction
-> 80935f1c  A/B/C/J cursor-lifecycle reconciliation
```

### Read-only ownership inventory accepted

Main accepts the following repository facts at `80935f1c`:

- migrations 001–006 create separate `accounts` and `account_cursor_state` tables but do not enforce
  total Account participation in cursor state;
- `account_cursor_state.account_id` is unique and references Accounts, so at most one row exists but
  zero remains representable;
- migration 002 removes runtime Account insertion but leaves direct runtime cursor insertion granted;
- hosted enrollment requires an existing identity/membership/Account and creates Device/enrollment
  state without cursor initialization;
- successful local harnesses and producers manually insert Account and cursor state separately;
- no production Account-provisioning service exists whose exclusive use can be proved;
- `markei_hosted_runtime_ready()` proves migration 006 only and cannot reject this provisioning gap.

These facts resolve the earlier mechanism question. An exclusive provisioning procedure would require
inventing and enforcing a new application boundary across all current direct Account insertions. A
database trigger is the narrower enforceable invariant and protects future trusted Account creation
regardless of orchestration path.

### Frozen implementation decision

Main activates:

```text
C10-MCG02-ACCOUNT-CURSOR-PROVISIONING-REPAIR_20260722
```

through current D/E/F.

The selected physical design is additive migration `007_account_cursor_provisioning` with checksum
`c10-mcg02-account-cursor-provisioning-v1`. It must:

1. backfill only missing cursor rows from `max(server_cursor) + 1`, or 1 with no events;
2. preserve every existing cursor row without update or reset;
3. install an Account `AFTER INSERT` trigger that creates cursor state in the same transaction;
4. revoke runtime cursor insertion while retaining required scoped select/update;
5. add `public.markei_hosted_runtime_ready_v2()` for the exact 006+007 contract;
6. update new API code to use readiness-v2 while preserving the 006 function for rollback;
7. retain Sync's missing-state HTTP 503 as defense in depth.

Enrollment repair, first-Sync lazy initialization, re-enrollment and ad hoc provider SQL remain
rejected. Migration 007 is locally authorized for Codex materialization and disposable proof only; it
is not authorized for Neon application or deployment.

### Required next evidence and continuation gate

Codex must produce G/H/I after failing-first and passing fresh/upgrade/backfill/preservation/
concurrency/rollback/ACL/RLS/readiness proof. Main must reconcile that evidence before any provider
action.

If local materialization passes, the later provider sequence remains separately gated:

```text
reconcile G/H/I
-> authorize migration/deployment order
-> apply 007 with migrator
-> verify readiness-v2 and Account cursor invariant read-only
-> deploy corrected API/client as authorized
-> run one harmless health-correlation check
-> capture fresh six-table baseline
-> authorize at most one exact-identity unresolved retry
```

### Materialized result accepted within its evidence boundary

Main accepts that `fe8976d8` materializes the bounded local unit:

```text
C10-MCG02-ACCOUNT-CURSOR-PROVISIONING-REPAIR_20260722
```

The implementation adds forward-only migration `007_account_cursor_provisioning`, identified by
checksum `c10-mcg02-account-cursor-provisioning-v1`. Migration 007:

1. backfills only missing `account_cursor_state` rows;
2. derives missing `next_cursor` as `max(sync_events.server_cursor) + 1`, or 1 when no events exist;
3. preserves every existing cursor row and value;
4. installs an `AFTER INSERT` Account trigger so Account and cursor state commit or roll back together;
5. revokes runtime cursor INSERT and DELETE while preserving scoped SELECT/UPDATE under RLS;
6. adds `public.markei_hosted_runtime_ready_v2()` for the exact 006+007 ledger contract;
7. changes new API readiness to v2 only, while retaining readiness-v1 for old-binary rollback;
8. retains the sanitized HTTP 503 `service-unavailable` / `not-applied` path when cursor state is still
   absent.

The trigger function was locally validated as migrator-owned, `SECURITY DEFINER`, fixed to
`pg_catalog, public`, fully qualified, non-dynamic and directly non-callable by PUBLIC/runtime.
Enrollment, re-enrollment, first Sync, Flutter and provider scripts do not acquire cursor-repair
responsibility.

### Validation reconciliation

The following claims are **validated locally** at `fe8976d8`:

- the dedicated migration-007 PostgreSQL producer passed 29/29 cases, including failing-first 006,
  fresh/upgrade, backfill/high-water, existing-row preservation, mixed Accounts, concurrency,
  rollback, trigger security, ACL/RLS, readiness and first protected submission;
- API format, lint, typecheck, build and 53/53 tests passed;
- hosted-local authorization passed 28 cases with zero pending;
- Flutter formatting, analysis and 178 tests passed with four lab-gated skips;
- opt-in disposable convergence passed 3/3 and recovery passed 1/1;
- Windows release and Android debug builds passed with only recorded upstream warnings;
- protected Python `unittest` regressions passed 5/5;
- production dependency audit passed with zero vulnerabilities after a bounded lockfile-only
  transitive `fast-uri` patch.

The following evidence remains qualified:

- `pytest` was host-unavailable because pytest was not installed; the protected `unittest` suite did
  run and pass;
- aggregate `r3_local_orchestrator` was not wholly green because the existing Flutter producer
  reported `query-replay-same-request-id:case-failed`, although direct Flutter, convergence and
  recovery suites passed;
- this contradiction does not invalidate the cursor-provisioning proofs, but it prevents Main from
  describing the complete aggregate recovery matrix as passed and must be resolved or explicitly
  bounded before provider mutation.

No Neon migration, Render deployment, Auth0 change, enrollment, real Sync, human database mutation or
unresolved-submission retry occurred. Therefore production Account provisioning, readiness-v2 and
protected Sync remain **provisional/provider-unvalidated**.

### PRC-01 disposition

```text
Claim: migration 007 and readiness-v2 exist
State: implemented
Evidence: repository inspection at fe8976d8

Claim: migration 007 enforces Account/cursor provisioning and repairs historical gaps
State: validated locally
Evidence: disposable PostgreSQL 29/29 producer and focused protocol/authorization proofs

Claim: complete aggregate local recovery matrix is green
State: contradicted / unresolved evidence composition
Evidence: aggregate Flutter producer query-replay-same-request-id case failed while direct suites passed

Claim: Neon contains migration 007 and the hosted Account has cursor state
State: not performed / provider-unvalidated

Claim: Render runs readiness-v2 code
State: not performed / provider-unvalidated

Claim: the preserved sync-unknown submission has a known terminal result
State: unresolved
```

No permanent-domain promotion is performed by this J append. G/H/I remain observational inputs for
the next Operational, Didactic and Design FLX-PRM-04 runs.

### Check route toward `sync-unknown` resolution

The next sequence is evidence-gated and must not collapse deployment readiness into Sync acceptance:

#### Gate 1 — close the aggregate local contradiction

1. Reproduce `query-replay-same-request-id:case-failed` through the aggregate producer.
2. Compare its inputs/environment with the directly passing convergence and recovery suites.
3. Correct an orchestration/fixture defect if present, or record why the aggregate case is outside the
   migration-007 claim boundary.
4. Require a green aggregate result or a new Main-accepted explicit evidence boundary before any
   provider mutation.

#### Gate 2 — provider migration authorization and preflight

1. Capture a fresh sanitized, read-only six-table baseline and migration-ledger/readiness-v1 state.
2. Confirm the preserved unknown submission identity and human local queue remain unchanged; do not
   transmit it.
3. Confirm exact migration-007 file identity/checksum and migrator/runtime role separation.
4. Authorize a single provider-migration window separately from deployment and Sync.

#### Gate 3 — apply 007 before deploying the new API

1. Apply migration 007 using the migrator identity in one transaction.
2. Verify the exact 006+007 ledger identities/checksums.
3. Verify readiness-v2 exists, is PUBLIC-denied and runtime-callable.
4. Verify the hosted Account has exactly one cursor row with the expected high-water-derived value.
5. Verify runtime cursor INSERT/DELETE and DDL remain denied while scoped SELECT/UPDATE remain allowed.
6. Stop on any mismatch; do not deploy or retry Sync.

Applying 007 first preserves rollback compatibility because the old API retains readiness-v1 support;
deploying the new API before 007 would intentionally make readiness-v2 fail closed.

#### Gate 4 — deploy and correlate the corrected API

1. Deploy commit `fe8976d8` or a reconciled descendant without provider-secret changes.
2. Correlate `/health/live` and `/health/ready` to one new deployment fingerprint.
3. Require live HTTP 200 and ready HTTP 200 backed by readiness-v2.
4. Capture a second sanitized six-table baseline; require no unexpected submissions, events,
   acknowledgements, Devices or cursor advancement.

#### Gate 5 — one exact-identity resolution attempt

Only after Gates 1–4 pass may Main authorize one retry of the preserved submission with the same
request identity and immutable event identities/content hashes.

Interpret the result conservatively:

- accepted or same-identity replay with matching server evidence: correlate response, submissions,
  events, acknowledgements and cursor advancement, then classify `sync-unknown` as resolved;
- HTTP 503 `not-applied`: do not repeat; investigate the provisioning/readiness invariant;
- identity/hash conflict: do not rewrite or retry under a new identity; reconcile local and server
  evidence;
- timeout, disconnect or missing trustworthy terminal response: the outcome remains unknown; capture
  the provider baseline before considering any further action;
- any unexpected count or cursor movement: stop and reconcile before another Sync operation.

`sync-unknown` is resolved only when the exact preserved request has a correlated terminal result and
the six-table provider state proves either one accepted/replayed application or a trustworthy
not-applied result. Deployment success, readiness-v2 HTTP 200 or cursor-row presence alone is not Sync
resolution.

## Append-only reconciliation entry — 2026-07-23 — Gate 2 provider preflight blocked on target resolution

> Sequence: FLX-ORD-01 Main reconciliation after bounded read-only provider preflight
> Repository observation: `0c8b37a63c1003431474df0972b846d3c8531a1a`
> Inputs: Codex Gate 2 in-chat report; current published G/H/I; prior J Gate 1 reconciliation
> Status: **GATE 2 BLOCKED; REPOSITORY AND RENDER REVISION OBSERVED; NEON AND PRESERVED-REQUEST TARGETS UNRESOLVED**

### Accepted observations within their evidence boundaries

Main accepts the following current observations:

1. branch and remote HEAD were aligned at `0c8b37a63c1003431474df0972b846d3c8531a1a`;
2. `.gitignore` remained the only tracked dirty path and was preserved;
3. `documentation/SECRET_INPUTS.md` was proven ignored, untracked, absent from history, non-symlinked and was not disclosed;
4. repository migration 007 identity, checksum label, SHA-256, predecessor, readiness-v1/v2 names and trigger objects were observed from source;
5. authenticated Render inspection succeeded and showed a live deployment at abbreviated revision `5b364216`, predating the corrected readiness-v2 code;
6. no deployment was in progress;
7. the selected local Drift candidate was schema version 10 and contained no `unknown` pending event or submission;
8. Neon session validation failed before a read-only transaction or catalog observation;
9. Render health endpoints were unavailable from the Codex host and therefore produced no HTTP-status evidence;
10. no provider, repository, local queue or deployment mutation occurred.

### Evidence conflict and consequence

The prior notebook observation expected one preserved unresolved request. The currently selected local database instead reports:

- pending events: pending 6, failed 2, unknown 0;
- submissions: failed/notApplied 1, superseded/notApplied 2, unknown 0;
- local Accounts 2, Devices 3, sync events 8 and sync attempts 6.

This does not establish that the preserved request was resolved. It remains classified as one of:

- selected-local-database target mismatch;
- genuine local state change;
- representation/status transition not yet correlated;
- unresolved contradiction.

The current evidence cannot safely choose among them. The affected Account selector, exact request identity, immutable event identities/content hashes and expected sequence comparison are unavailable. The prior comparison evidence remains historical context but is insufficient to prove unchanged identity against the currently selected database.

Neon migration, readiness, six-table counts, role separation, ACL and RLS state are unavailable because the supplied Neon sessions failed before validated read-only access. Render metadata independently establishes only that the corrected revision is not deployed. Health success is not evidenced.

### PRC-01 disposition

```text
Claim: repository contains migration 007 and readiness-v2 contract
State: observed / source-validated

Claim: Render currently runs the corrected readiness-v2 revision
State: contradicted
Evidence: authenticated deployment metadata reports older revision 5b364216

Claim: Neon remains at exact migrations 001-006 with readiness-v1 only
State: unavailable
Evidence: session validation failed before catalog inspection

Claim: the preserved sync-unknown request remains unchanged in the inspected local store
State: contradicted / unresolved target
Evidence: selected schema-v10 database contains zero unknown rows

Claim: the preserved request has a known terminal result
State: unresolved

Claim: Gate 2 provider preflight is green
State: rejected / blocked
```

G/H/I on GitHub remain the earlier migration-007 local materialization reports. They contain useful local implementation, didactic and design evidence, but no Gate 2 provider-preflight staging was written during this round.

### Rescheduled GCM-02 route — remaining steps 4 through 14

The remaining closure route contains eleven evidence-gated steps:

4. **Resolve local target identity.** Keep Markei closed. Locate every bounded source-derived schema-v10 candidate and identify which database, if any, contains the historical request or a correlated terminal transition. Record candidate count, schema fingerprint, sanitized path class, status counts and last-change classification; do not retry.
5. **Resolve historical request continuity.** Compare the prior request/event fingerprints and expected Device sequence against the correct local store. If exact fingerprints were never preserved, record comparison unavailable and establish a new current baseline without retroactively claiming unchanged state.
6. **Repair Neon session access only.** Validate migrator and runtime connection parsing, intended development target, TLS/channel binding and distinct identities. Do not use owner access and do not apply SQL.
7. **Repeat Neon read-only preflight.** Capture ledger 001-007, readiness-v1/v2 catalog, six-table counts, cursor/high-water, ACL, RLS and runtime denial evidence inside read-only transactions. Save sanitized success/error messages and session/target fingerprints.
8. **Complete Render preflight evidence.** Capture deployment fingerprint plus direct `/health/live` and `/health/ready` HTTP statuses from an operator-reachable host. The old deployment may be live; ready semantics must be classified against the old readiness contract.
9. **Reconcile and authorize the migration window.** Main compares steps 4-8. Gate 3 is authorized only if provider target, migration 006 integrity and the request baseline are sufficiently resolved. Migration, deployment and Sync remain separate authorizations.
10. **Apply migration 007 once.** Use the migrator identity and the committed SQL file in one transactional run. Capture file SHA-256, ledger identity/checksum, transaction success/error text and provider-target fingerprint. Stop on any mismatch.
11. **Verify post-migration database state.** Read-only verify exact 006+007 ledger, readiness-v2 metadata/callability, one cursor row per Account, high-water-derived backfill, trigger ownership/security, runtime INSERT/DELETE/DDL denial and scoped SELECT/UPDATE allowance. Capture sanitized query outcomes.
12. **Deploy the reconciled corrected revision.** Deploy `0c8b37a` or a later explicitly reconciled descendant, without unrelated provider-secret changes. Capture full/abbreviated Git revision, Render deploy identifier fingerprint, start/finish timestamps and final status.
13. **Correlate health and provider immobility.** Require `/health/live = 200` and `/health/ready = 200` from the same deployment fingerprint, then capture a fresh six-table baseline showing no unexplained submission, event, acknowledgement, Device or cursor movement.
14. **Authorize and perform at most one exact-identity resolution attempt.** Only after steps 4-13 reconcile. Reuse the immutable request/event identities and hashes; capture HTTP result, sanitized response classification, request-correlation fingerprint, before/after six-table counts, cursor range and acknowledgement evidence. Conclude GCM-02 only if the request obtains a trustworthy correlated terminal result; otherwise stop with `sync-unknown` still open.

### Authorization boundary

Migration 007 may be prepared in the Neon SQL Editor, but it must not be executed merely because its text is visible there. The committed file identity and a green repeated preflight must precede execution.

A Render API token is not an application runtime dependency. It is required only for authenticated Render management/inspection automation. The current Codex round successfully read Render deployment metadata, proving that missing Render API access was not the blocker. Markei runtime requires its configured database and authentication variables, not a Render account API token.

## 2026-07-23 — GRIMOIRE human-operationalisation inner sprint and Gate 02 closure

### Sprint identity

```text
Sequence: FLX-ORD-01 bounded human-supervised operational materialization
Cycle: 10
Phase: GCM-02 closure recovery
Gate: 02 — account cursor provisioning
Inner sprint: GRIMOIRE human-operationalisation check-up and build
Repository baseline: 837e9e18706b1eccb2bfafc0bf8980b69e1acf0a
Human authority: explicit
```

### Purpose and system mechanics

GRIMOIRE is the human-facing operational interface between project intent and
reviewed automation. It implements a hemi-automated chain:

```text
human selects a minimal indexed command
→ versioned PowerShell launcher validates local prerequisites and target role
→ committed mitigated-risk coordinates supply non-secret endpoint identity
→ password is entered only through a masked terminal prompt
→ Docker supplies the pinned PostgreSQL 18 client
→ libpq requires TLS and channel binding
→ SQL verifies database role and database identity
→ named SQL action or exact tracked migration is selected
→ mutation requires an explicit human confirmation boundary
→ sanitized evidence returns to the operator
→ Main/Operational reconciliation records meaning and next authority
```

The operational collection separates responsibilities:

- `GRIMOIRE.md` explains architecture, safety boundaries, workflow, failure
  classification, proven checkpoints, and ends with the active minimal-command
  index;
- `GENERAL_SCRIPTS.md` provides expanded operator commands and validation
  sequences;
- `models/NEON_CHECK.ps1` owns masked credentials, Docker `psql`, role/database
  preflight, TLS/channel-binding enforcement, action dispatch, exact migration
  path containment, Git tracking/cleanliness checks, SHA-256 display, and
  explicit mutation confirmation;
- `models/NEON_ACTION.sql` owns delimited, named, predominantly read-only SQL
  evidence blocks;
- root `NEON_ACTION.sql`, `NEON_CHECK.ps1`, and `NEON_CRED.md` preserve the
  user-uploaded operational originals;
- `NEON_CRED.md` is committed under an explicit mitigated-risk decision,
  stores only non-secret target coordinates and role names, and contains
  neither passwords nor complete connection URLs;
- `SECRET_INPUTS.md` remains the sole ignored private input surface.

Executable mechanics, reusable models, and minimal non-secret coordinates are
versioned. Secret inputs are not. Minimal commands are treated as stable
interfaces into reviewed verbose mechanics; when an action or variable name
changes, every reference must be reconciled in the same focused change.

### Failure-to-system learning

The sprint resolved four recurrent operator/tooling defects:

1. recycled download filenames produced stale script revisions, so development
   revisions use unique immutable names before promotion to the canonical
   repository filename;
2. `$PSScriptRoot` was unsafe in parameter defaults, so companion paths are
   resolved after script initialization;
3. server-side `pg_stat_ssl` behind Neon proxying was not authoritative for
   the client transport, so the launcher instead enforces
   `PGSSLMODE=require` and `PGCHANNELBINDING=require` and treats successful
   libpq authentication under those requirements as transport evidence;
4. textual Windows path-prefix comparison was separator-sensitive, so exact
   migration containment uses a parent-directory walk before Git tracked/clean
   checks.

### Gate 02 applied and validated evidence

Migration `007_account_cursor_provisioning.sql` was applied once with:

```text
role: markei_migrator
database: markei_sync_dev
client TLS/channel binding: required
file SHA-256: 89AB11302F8B860C52AA1C74FBFEDF6A4DB3A0EE62FE7CB715B20B74AEF99AC6
confirmation: APPLY-ONCE
transaction terminal: COMMIT
```

Postflight returned:

```text
migration_id: 007_account_cursor_provisioning
checksum: c10-mcg02-account-cursor-provisioning-v1
readiness_v2: true
provisioning function: present
provisioning trigger count: 1
account count: 1
cursor-state count: 1
accounts missing cursor state: 0
orphan cursor-state rows: 0
runtime SELECT: true
runtime INSERT: false
runtime DELETE: false
runtime next_cursor UPDATE: true
runtime readiness-v2 EXECUTE: true
runtime provisioning EXECUTE: false
inspection terminal: ROLLBACK
action terminal: PASS
```

The false privilege values are intended least-privilege boundaries and are not
caused by absent Flutter activity. Migration 007 must not be reapplied.

### Resulting state and next authority

```text
GRIMOIRE_BASELINE_ESTABLISHED
MIGRATION_007_APPLIED_ONCE
GATE_02_POSTFLIGHT_PASS
ACCOUNT_CURSOR_INVARIANT_PASS
RUNTIME_PRIVILEGE_SHAPE_PASS_BY_MIGRATOR_INSPECTION
GATE_02_CLOSED
RUNTIME_ROLE_DIRECT_READINESS_CHECK_NEXT
RENDER_CORRECTED_REVISION_NOT_YET_RECONCILED
REAL_SYNC_RETRY_UNAUTHORIZED
GCM02_OPEN
```

The next bounded operation is a direct runtime-role connection and
`markei_hosted_runtime_ready_v2()` call. After that passes, reconcile GitHub
HEAD and Render deployment revision, deploy only an explicitly authorized
reconciled revision, and require live/ready HTTP 200 evidence before any
controlled Sync attempt.

## 2026-07-25 — Render/Auth0 preflight and exact binding progress

### Accepted progress

The human-operated closure sequence advanced through the non-mutating host and
identity gates:

```text
Windows release build: PASS
Render live: HTTP 200
Render ready: HTTP 200
Auth0 issuer: match
Auth0 audience: match
Auth0 algorithm: RS256 match
Auth0 subject: present
Auth0 time window: valid
hosted identity endpoint: HTTP 200
exact Device endpoint: HTTP 200
token accepted: true
exact Device binding: true
binding class: exact-binding-confirmed
```

The native Windows build initially failed because a refreshed PowerShell
session no longer exposed the already required vcpkg/`cpprestsdk` and Visual
Studio tool locations. Restoring those session-local coordinates and
regenerating the build output produced a successful build without a source
change. The Auth0 access token was inspected from the paused debugger,
submitted only through a masked session prompt and was not pasted into chat or
committed. The fixture Device UUID was likewise entered only through the
masked local prompt.

### Reconciled consequence

These observations close the public-metadata and exact-binding gates within
their inspected checkpoint. They do not constitute a Sync attempt and do not
authorize one. The current restart point is the exact read-only provider
baseline, followed by the predeclared single-transition allowlist and a new
human authorization boundary.
