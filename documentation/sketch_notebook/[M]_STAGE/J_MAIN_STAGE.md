## 1. Reconciliation

R04B proved Docker/PostgreSQL availability and added an inert barrier interface, phase names, several
reach points and containment tests. Git later published that partial work as fab9357.

R04B did not add:

- an active lab barrier controller;
- participant-aware reach/release coordination;
- an Account state observer;
- case-addressable authorization scenarios;
- producer completion or R04 aggregation.

Source inspection also found:

- enrollment reaches before-protected-mutation after earlier durable writes;
- before-commit is a generic database callback without operation/participant context.

Therefore:

~~~text
C10-MCG02-R04B_PARTIAL
AUTHORIZATION_RACE_PRODUCER=false
R3_LOCAL_SECURITY_PROVED=false
~~~

## 2. Strategy correction

The previous unit was too broad. R04 is now decomposed into independently successful slices:

~~~text
R04C01  proof infrastructure + one membership-denial slice
R04C02  identity, membership and actor-Device route matrix
R04C03  target Device and enrollment concurrency
R04C04  response loss, restart, retry exhaustion and final R04 aggregate
R05      complete Flutter HTTP/file-backed proof and global local aggregate
MCG-02   human/provider Auth0 + Neon + Render proof
Promotion and Main Cycle 10 closure
~~~

Only R04C01 is active.

## 3. R04C01 objective

Build reusable proof infrastructure and prove one complete scenario:

~~~text
working deterministic barrier controller
+ corrected transaction phase placement
+ canonical Account state observer
+ membership-disabled-before-fence upload denial
~~~

The authorization producer remains false after this unit. That is expected and does not make
R04C01 partial.

## 4. Reusable infrastructure

R04C01 selects:

- a participant-aware lab barrier controller;
- context-aware transaction lifecycle signaling;
- canonical payload-free Account snapshots;
- a reusable arrange/snapshot/pause/intervene/release/compare scenario runner;
- deterministic cleanup and safe ScenarioResult output.

Later R04 and recovery/synchronization assays should add scenarios to these mechanisms rather than
rebuild them.

## 5. Phase corrections

Required meanings:

| Phase | Placement |
| --- | --- |
| before-identity-membership-fence | inside transaction, before current identity/membership resolution |
| after-membership-lock | only after relevant identity/membership rows are actually locked |
| before-actor-device-lock | immediately before actor Device FOR UPDATE |
| before-target-transition | after authorization/locks, immediately before transition |
| before-protected-mutation | immediately before the first durable write |
| before-commit | after writes and before COMMIT, with operation/participant context |

R04C01 must correct enrollment placement and remove or replace context-free before-commit behavior.

## 6. Representative scenario

Use membership-disabled-before-fence on a valid upload:

1. seed an active identity, membership and Device;
2. prepare a valid purchase submission;
3. capture Account state;
4. pause upload before membership resolution;
5. disable membership from a control transaction;
6. commit the control transition;
7. release upload;
8. require typed 403 authorization denial;
9. capture Account state again;
10. prove protected synchronization state did not advance.

The membership status transition itself is expected. Facts, submissions, events, cursors,
acknowledgements, recovery state, Devices and security-event state must otherwise remain unchanged.

## 7. R04C01 terminal

Success:

~~~text
R04C01_BARRIER_CONTROLLER=true
R04C01_ACCOUNT_OBSERVER=true
R04C01_MEMBERSHIP_DENIAL_SLICE=true
AUTHORIZATION_RACE_PRODUCER=false
R04_REMAINING_CASES_PENDING
C10-MCG02-R04C01_PROVED
~~~

Do not mark denied-no-state-advance globally true. It remains pending until the wider matrix covers
all required state families.

## 8. Validation boundary

R04C01 validates:

- Docker/PostgreSQL preflight;
- barrier controller lifecycle and timeout tests;
- phase-placement tests;
- Account snapshot canonicalization;
- real Fastify/PostgreSQL representative scenario;
- complete server format/lint/typecheck/tests/build;
- diff, secret and teardown checks.

Full Flutter builds, all proof producers and global aggregation return in R04C04/R05 unless a shared
contract changed.

## 9. Scope boundary

R04C01 excludes:

- the other 27 authorization cases;
- provider access or credentials;
- migrations, dependencies, lockfiles and Drift changes;
- Flutter R05 work;
- UI, MCG-03, MCG-04, deployment and permanent promotion.

Production correction requires a retained failing vertical-slice test and must remain narrow.

## 10. Forward coordination

After R04C01 reconciliation:

- R04C02 reuses the controller/observer for identity, membership and actor Device cases;
- R04C03 reuses them for target and enrollment concurrency;
- R04C04 adds response-loss/restart/retry evidence and runs the full authorization aggregate;
- R05 proves the complete Flutter transport/file-backed boundary;
- human MCG-02 proves provider configuration;
- functional domains promote accepted evidence;
- Main closes Cycle 10 only after all named gates reconcile.

No later unit is automatically authorized by R04C01 completion.

## 11. Append-only reconciliation — R04C01 result

R04C01 is accepted as validated local evidence within its declared boundary.

Evidence reconciled:

- the remote implementation is a direct child of the controlling D/E/F commit;
- the participant-aware controller, Account observer and reusable scenario runner exist;
- enrollment protected-mutation and target-transition placement were corrected;
- the real upload scenario records a typed 403 after a committed membership disable;
- protected Account synchronization state remains unchanged except for the expected membership
  transition;
- Codex recorded 8 focused tests and 45 total server tests passing;
- Main independently reran format, lint, typecheck, all 45 server tests, build and production audit;
- `git diff --check` passed and the commit changed only the authorized server/proof/report paths.

Main could not independently rerun Docker because Docker is unavailable in the reconciliation
environment. The committed scenario and the recorded Windows/Docker PostgreSQL 18.4 run remain the
environment-scoped evidence for the real database case.

R04C01 terminal accepted:

## 12. Evidence corrections retained

G/H/I contain two report-header defects:

1. their controlling D/E/F SHA repeats the J SHA; the correct D/E/F SHA is `2f7272a8...`;
2. their implementation tree and final commit fields remained `pending`; Git resolves them to tree
   `0740d103...` and commit `40e0a70...`.

These are observational metadata corrections. They do not invalidate the executed tests or source
evidence. Codex must resolve commit/tree fields accurately in the next G/H/I reports.

## 13. Phase-scheme revision

The earlier forward scheme is preserved above as history. Current coordination merges the former
R04C02 and R04C03 because R04C01 proved their shared controller, observer, fixture and scenario
foundation. R04C04 remains separate because transport loss, process restart and deterministic retry
exhaustion require materially different mechanisms.

Current scheme:

~~~text
R04C01  reusable proof infrastructure + membership-disabled slice       VALIDATED
R04C02  core authorization matrix: identity/member/actor/target/enroll  ACTIVE
R04C04  response loss + restart + retry exhaustion + final R04 aggregate PENDING
R05      Flutter HTTP/file-backed proof + global local aggregate          PENDING
MCG-02   human Auth0 + Neon + Render proof                                PENDING
Promotion and Main Cycle 10 closure                                       PENDING
~~~

R04C02 uses three internal checkpoints:

~~~text
CP-A  identity, membership and actor-Device race cases
CP-B  target authorization, revoke concurrency and later actor denial
CP-C  equivalent/conflicting enrollment concurrency
~~~

The unit may be one commit, but each checkpoint must produce case-addressable results before the
next begins. A failed checkpoint remains diagnosable and cannot be converted into inherited truth.

## 14. R04C02 acceptance boundary

R04C02 must execute cases 2–24 of the existing authorization producer while retaining the validated
case 1. It may then report 24 true cases and exactly four pending cases:

- response-loss-query-replay;
- process-restart-replay;
- serialization-retry-exhaustion-fails-closed;
- denied-no-state-advance.

`AUTHORIZATION_RACE_PRODUCER` remains false until R04C04. R04C02 success is therefore a bounded
matrix checkpoint, not local-security or provider completion.

## 15. Forward authority

D/E/F carrying marker `C10-MCG02-R04C02_20260717T151546Z` are the only active Codex authority.
R04C04, R05, provider mutation, permanent promotion and Cycle 10 closure remain unauthorized.

R04C02 is accepted as validated local evidence within its declared boundary.

Evidence reconciled:

- the implementation is a direct child of the controlling staging commit;
- all 24 core cases are produced from structured scenario results;
- actor-denial cases use real protected routes and valid route-specific fixtures;
- target authorization, one-transition/one-event revoke truth and enrollment convergence are
  represented by committed scenario code;
- one retained failing Device-management scenario justified a narrow barrier-placement correction;
- Codex recorded CP-A/B/C passing, 46 server tests, build, audit and clean teardown;
- Main independently reran format, lint, typecheck, 46/46 tests, build and production audit;
- `git diff --check` passed and only authorized server/proof/report paths changed.

Main could not rerun Docker in the reconciliation environment. The committed scenarios and recorded
Windows/Docker/PostgreSQL 18.4 execution remain the environment-scoped database evidence.

## 17. Reconciliation qualifications

G/H/I again left implementation tree and commit fields pending. Git resolves them above. Future
reports must distinguish authoring-time pending metadata from Main-resolved final metadata.

`authorization_slice_scenarios.ts` grew to 1,669 lines. This does not invalidate R04C02, but it is a
recovery and maintenance liability. R04C04 must split scenario infrastructure by responsibility
before adding its three mechanisms. The refactor must preserve behavior and pass the existing 24
cases before new case work begins.

## 18. Current phase scheme

~~~text

R04C04 has four ordered checkpoints:

~~~text
CP-0  split oversized scenario module without semantic change
CP-1  response-loss query replay and process-restart replay
CP-2  deterministic serialization retry exhaustion with no state advance
CP-3  derive global denied-no-state-advance and run final R04 aggregation
~~~

## 19. R04C04 acceptance boundary

R04C04 must make the remaining four authorization cases true from executed evidence, then make the
authorization producer true. The R04 orchestrator must accept migration, JWKS, route, static and
authorization producers as true while Flutter remains validly false only for `not-yet-r05`.

Success proves the server-side R04 authorization boundary. It does not prove Flutter transport,
provider configuration, production deployment, full MCG-02 or Cycle 10 closure.

## 20. Forward authority

D/E/F carrying marker `C10-MCG02-R04C04_20260717T154951Z` are the only active Codex authority.
R05, providers, permanent promotion, MCG-03/04 and Cycle 10 closure remain unauthorized.

R04C04 completed the behavioral proof:

- response-loss query replay recovered one committed enrollment result;
- process-restart replay recovered the same PostgreSQL truth in a new composition;
- retry exhaustion recorded three bounded attempts and zero durable protected advance;
- denied-no-state-advance was derived from a closed executed denial set;
- all 28 authorization cases and the authorization producer passed;
- the R04 orchestrator reported proof-pipeline integrity true with Flutter false only for R05.

Codex recorded Docker/PostgreSQL 18.4 execution, clean teardown, all server checks and producer runs.
Main independently reran format, lint, typecheck, 46/46 server tests, build and audit. Docker was not
available in Main's environment, so real producer/orchestrator execution remains Codex's recorded
environment-scoped evidence.

## 22. Structural observation and disposition

`authorization_slice_scenarios.ts` grew to 1,936 lines. Length alone is not drift or a failed gate:
the module still compiles, passes its tests and produces the required closed evidence. Main therefore
does not insert a mandatory mid-phase solely to reduce line count.

The scenario-module split is recorded as Cycle 10 pruning work. It should occur after the decisive
R05 proof, when the complete proof topology can be reorganized without repeatedly moving an active
boundary. This disposition supersedes the unmaterialized CP-0 preference without weakening R04's
behavioral result.

## 24. R05 acceptance boundary

R05 must make all 16 `flutter-http-file-backed` cases true through real Flutter transport,
file-backed Drift and loopback hosted API evidence. It must preserve local facts/outbox across every
failure and unknown outcome, prove one absolute request deadline and client ownership, and prove
that bearer tokens are ephemeral and absent from durable state/log output.

After the Flutter producer passes, the global aggregator must accept all six producers and report
`R3_LOCAL_SECURITY_PROVED=true`. Provider acceptance remains a separate human MCG-02 gate.

D/E/F carrying marker `C10-MCG02-R05_20260717T162323Z` are the only active Codex authority.

R05 completed the local Flutter and global proof boundary:

- all 16 `flutter-http-file-backed` cases passed from closed case records;
- real Flutter HTTP transport and file-backed Drift preserved facts and pending outbox state;
- response-loss replay, process-safe query replay, absolute deadline and client ownership passed;
- bearer-token material was absent from the inspected Drift bytes and retained diagnostic state;
- the Flutter producer and all five earlier producers passed the strict global aggregator;
- the final orchestrator reported proof-pipeline integrity and local R3 security true;
- Flutter analysis/tests, Android debug, Windows release and server validation passed in Codex's
  recorded environment; Docker/PostgreSQL resources were torn down.

Main inspected the final Git tree, reports and strict producer/orchestrator implementation. The
commit changes only proof infrastructure, one Flutter proof test and G/H/I; it does not mutate
production provider configuration, migrations, dependencies, UI or permanent memory. `git diff
--check` passed. Main's attempted independent npm reinstall was inconclusive because the execution
environment could not create its npm cache and returned corrupted-download warnings; this is an
environment limitation, not contrary behavioral evidence.

## 27. Phase decision

The next phase is not MCG-03. Permanent memory still defines MCG-03 and MCG-04 as undefined and
inactive. R05 proves local readiness only; it does not prove Auth0, Neon, Render or deployment.

The remaining ordered work is:

~~~text
R05 local Flutter/global proof                                      VALIDATED
MCG-02 human Auth0 + Neon + Render provider proof                   NEXT

MCG-03 / MCG-04 definition                                          INACTIVE
~~~

MCG-02 provider proof must use sanitized evidence and the existing manual instructions. It must
validate the configured issuer/audience/JWKS boundary, direct migrator versus pooled runtime Neon
roles, forward migrations, Render HTTPS composition, explicit Account membership and Device
enrollment, denial cases and one synthetic hosted synchronization path. Secrets, provider IDs,
tokens, hostnames and connection strings must remain outside Git and reports.

## 28. Forward authority

R05 D/E/F are spent implementation authority. No replacement D/E/F or Codex implementation seed is
issued at this gate because provider-console actions and sanitized human evidence are required
first. Main must reconcile that evidence before authorizing pruning, permanent promotion, Cycle 10
closure or defining MCG-03/04.

---

## 29. Provider-proof staging activation

At the human operator's request, D/E/F now carry a bounded MCG-02 provider-proof contract. This does
not reopen Codex source implementation. It authorizes human configuration and sanitized evidence
capture across the disposable Auth0, Neon and Render development resources, with Codex limited to
read-only preparation, redacted diagnosis and later evidence reconciliation.

Repository inspection found bearer-token transport ports but no Flutter Auth0 SDK/login composition
or production credential supplier. The active unit is therefore narrowed to provider containment,
Auth0 contract, Neon migrations/privileges and Render HTTPS foundation readiness. Main will
reconcile that evidence before staging native client authentication and the decisive hosted proof.
Manual token copying cannot stand in for native login evidence.

D/E/F carrying marker `C10-MCG02-PROVIDER-PROOF_20260717T171443Z` are current authority. MCG-03/04,
production launch, pruning/promotion and Cycle 10 closure remain inactive.

## 30. Append-only reconciliation — provider foundation result

> Reconciliation marker: C10-MCG02-NATIVE-CLOSURE_20260718T140335Z

> Current status: **PROVIDER FOUNDATION VALIDATED; NATIVE CLOSURE SELECTED**

Main accepts the sanitized human evidence for the disposable provider foundation:

- all exposed owner, migrator and runtime credentials were rotated and old access contained;
- Neon migrations 002–006 have the expected ledger identifiers and checksum tags;
- direct `markei_migrator` and pooled `markei_runtime` remain separate;
- runtime readiness returned true while DDL, ledger access, role administration, controlled-table
  mutation and Account visibility without context failed closed;
- Render built and deployed exact commit `ade6e2c`, emitted `MARKEI_HOSTED_SYNC_READY`, returned 200
  from live/ready and 401 from an unauthenticated protected route;
- Render logs disclosed no connection string, password, bearer token or fact payload;
- Auth0 discovery and JWKS returned 200, issuer/JWKS URI matched, RS256 was advertised and two keys
  were present;
- the Android and Windows applications remain Native applications with Authorization Code enabled,
  Client Credentials disabled and no native client secret.

Accepted foundation terminal:

~~~text
MCG-02_PROVIDER_CONTAINMENT=true
MCG-02_AUTH0_TOKEN_CONTRACT=true
MCG-02_NEON_MIGRATIONS_AND_PRIVILEGES=true
MCG-02_RENDER_HTTPS_RUNTIME=true
MCG-02_PROVIDER_FOUNDATION_READY
~~~

This evidence closes provider configuration only. No Android or Windows client has yet obtained an
Auth0 access token through the Markei Flutter composition, and no two-Device hosted convergence has
been executed. `MCG-02_NATIVE_CLIENT_AUTH_INTEGRATION` and full MCG-02 remain false.

## 31. Repository reconciliation

The repository already has application ports and tested HTTP adapters for authentication state,
ephemeral bearer-token supply, identity lookup and Device enrollment. It does not have an Auth0
Flutter dependency, production Auth0 adapter, typed native configuration or Android/Windows login
composition. Existing lab authentication must remain confined to tests and loopback proof code.

The next unit therefore changes only the native authentication edge and its proof harness. It does
not reopen PostgreSQL migrations 001–006, server authorization, provider resources, retention,
snapshots or synchronization semantics.

Codex must implement one fail-closed Auth0 composition for Android and Windows behind the existing
application ports. Non-secret provider configuration must be injected, validated and absent from
committed defaults. Access tokens must be requested for the exact Markei API audience, remain
ephemeral, never enter Drift/logs, and be cleared on logout, rejection and expiry.

The unit must provide deterministic tests and a bounded development-only closure surface or runner
that allows the human operator to perform native login, identity resolution, Device enrollment and
hosted synchronization without copying tokens. It must not seed membership, operate provider
consoles or claim real provider acceptance from fakes.

After Codex reports local composition readiness, the human proof must execute Android and Windows
native login, explicit identity/membership mapping, two distinct Device enrollments, one synthetic
Account convergence and the required denial matrix through Render HTTPS and Neon. Main must
reconcile that sanitized evidence before MCG-02 or Cycle 10 can close.

## 34. Forward authority

D/E/F carrying marker `C10-MCG02-NATIVE-CLOSURE_20260718T140335Z` are the only active Codex
authority. Provider mutation, database migration, automatic user provisioning, permanent promotion,
Cycle 10 closure and MCG-03/04 remain unauthorized.

## 35. Append-only reconciliation — native composition result

> Current status: **NATIVE AUTH COMPOSITION ACCEPTED; CLOSURE HARNESS CORRECTION REQUIRED**

Main accepts the following implementation evidence:

- Auth0 Flutter 2.4.0 is pinned behind infrastructure adapters;
- typed compile-time configuration fails closed without committed provider values;
- Authorization Code + PKCE requests the exact configured API audience;
- access tokens remain process-memory bounded and clear on logout, expiry or rejection;
- ID-token substitution is rejected and lab authentication is not selected by production
  composition;
- Android callback composition and debug build passed;
- 10 focused tests and the complete 72-test Flutter suite passed with two existing skips;
- analysis, formatting, dependency lock and secret checks passed;
- migrations, server authorization, Drift schema and provider resources were unchanged.

Main could not independently rerun Flutter because the reconciliation environment has no Flutter
toolchain. This is an environment exclusion, not contrary evidence.

## 36. Material gaps

The implementation does not yet satisfy the closure harness required by section 33:

1. `NativeAuthClosureRunner` is composed and tested but has no development-only app entry point;
   a human cannot initiate the required sequence from Android or Windows.
2. `hostedSyncProbe()` calls Device-enrollment replay and returns `hosted-sync-available` when a
   server Device exists. It does not upload/download events, apply them, acknowledge them or compare
   Account facts; its name and success state therefore overclaim the executed behavior.
3. Windows runner code exists, but no Windows release binary was built because Developer Mode and
   symlink support were unavailable on the Codex host.
4. G/H/I still say final commit status pending; later reports must record the actual final SHA.

These are bounded closure deficiencies, not a rejection of the Auth0 adapter. MCG-02 remains open,
and MCG-03 remains inactive.

## 38. Forward authority

D/E/F carrying marker `C10-MCG02-NATIVE-CLOSURE-R1_20260718T145121Z` are the only active Codex
authority. The unit must correct the observable closure path without changing the accepted Auth0,
server, database or synchronization contracts. Real provider operation remains human-controlled.
