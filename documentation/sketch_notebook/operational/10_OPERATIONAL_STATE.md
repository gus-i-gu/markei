# 1. Current Cycle State

Cycle 06 remains accepted and closed for the controlled Windows primary beta.

Cycle 07 Sprint 02 planning and A/B/C Flutter restaging are complete. Main reconciliation is complete, and permanent-domain reconciliation is active. No application code, Flutter project, TypeScript API, database schema, authentication integration, Neon infrastructure, or D/E/F/G/H/I work has been authorized or produced.

```text
Cycle 06: accepted and closed
Cycle 07 Sprint 02 planning: complete
Flutter A/B/C restaging: complete
Main reconciliation: complete
Operational permanent-memory reconciliation: active/completed by this checkpoint
implementation authorization: none
D/E/F: postponed
next evidence target: Sprint 03 preparation
```

# 2. Accepted Planning Decisions

Accepted for planning and permanent-domain classification:

- Flutter/Dart is the shared Windows/Android/iOS client basis.
- TypeScript is favored for the synchronization API/protocol harness.
- Neon Postgres is favored as managed shared persistence.
- Every installation remains local-first with application-private storage.
- Account data is owned by immutable account UUID, not email.
- The first beta uses an account-private reusable catalogue.
- Purchase is an atomic aggregate containing one or more Purchase Items.
- One append-only `purchase.registered` event contains immutable item lines.
- Retry identity uses event UUID; one device uses UUID plus monotonic sequence; downloads use an opaque account-scoped cursor.
- Downloaded events and cursor advancement commit together locally.
- Raw facts remain authoritative; projections and Dart analytics are rebuildable and versioned.
- PySide6 and the original Cycle 06 database remain protected until evidenced parity and human/Main acceptance.
- No embedded Python runtime or client IPC bridge belongs in the Flutter client.

Accepted planning does not mean implemented, packaged, validated, deployed, or production-ready.

# 3. Provisional and Untested Decisions

The following are preferred experiment candidates or definitions requiring fixtures:

- Drift as the first Flutter SQLite candidate;
- `sqflite_common_ffi` as the retained persistence comparison;
- `flutter_secure_storage` as a credential-storage candidate;
- exact Flutter project layout and state/navigation choices;
- exact TypeScript API framework, Node runtime, hosting platform, and migration tool;
- authentication provider;
- Neon role, schema, branching, pooling, limits, and recovery behavior;
- deterministic Product UUID derivation and normalization versioning;
- exact decimal scale/ranges, fractional COUNT policy, and currency metadata;
- RLS as defense in depth;
- exact parity threshold for PySide6 retirement.

No compatibility claim for these candidates is validated. Windows and Android require empirical build/run evidence. iOS is explicitly unvalidated until macOS/Xcode execution.

# 4. Next Evidence Target — Sprint 03 Preparation

The next bounded evidence unit should prepare, then later execute only if D/E/F authorize:

```text
pinned Flutter/Dart + TypeScript/Node environments
→ canonical Dart/TypeScript JSON fixtures
→ fresh isolated local databases for simulated devices A/B
→ exact normalization and advisory-only similarity behavior
→ packaged/bulk catalogue identity
→ atomic Purchase + Items + pending event
→ close/reopen and projection/analytics rebuild
→ local TypeScript API + disposable Postgres
→ retry / sequence-gap / cursor / bootstrap / restart / account-isolation gates
→ Windows and Android build/run
→ Cycle 06 database isolation
→ iOS later through macOS/Xcode
→ non-production Neon only after local protocol proof
```

# 5. Scope and Recovery

No framework initialization, tool installation, database access, infrastructure provisioning, authentication account creation, deployment, source modification, or D/E/F/G/H/I activity is authorized.

Recovery route:

```text
1. Read this checkpoint.
2. Read 04_TODO.md for Sprint 03 preparation gates.
3. Read 11_OPERATIONAL_RECORD.md for chronology and candidate evidence boundaries.
4. Read J sections 17–18 for Main planning acceptance.
5. Read 12_OPERATIONAL_MODEL.md for stable technology-independent rules.
```

# Cycle 07 Sprint 05 Operational Checkpoint

## Implemented and validated

```text
Cycle 06 Python/PySide6 beta: accepted and protected
Flutter/Dart SDK: H: path selected and doctor-evidenced
Android Studio/SDK 36/tool components: installed
Android licenses/toolchain: doctor-validated
application ID/label: com.gusigu.markei / Markei
persistent app-private Device UUID: implemented and tested
Flutter tests: 27 passed
debug APK: built and identity-inspected
API-36 emulator: booted
APK: installed and launched
app-private Drift database: runtime-observed
Purchase registration: human-confirmed
Windows Flutter build: passed
Python regressions: 5 passed
```

Repository truth supports the source, test, identity, APK, emulator, database, Windows, and Python claims. The local event queue remains synchronization preparation only.

## Partial, contradictory, and deferred

Partial: force-stop/relaunch and database inspection provide meaningful persistence evidence, but the required keyboard, Back, rotation, background/resume, text-scale, staged-state, and human-visible History-after-restart matrix is incomplete. One emulator is evidenced; no physical device is validated.

Contradiction: G says `devtools_options.yaml` was not committed; repository truth shows it added. It is harmless empty-extension configuration, but intentional ownership is unresolved and deferred to bounded hygiene.

Deferred: physical device, Android release/signing/upgrade/backup/accessibility/Play Store, iOS, authentication, TypeScript API, Postgres/Neon, real synchronization, central catalogue, legacy import, editing/deletion, and PySide6 retirement.

## Current operational decision

A supplemental Android lifecycle checklist is required before ordinary Sprint 05 closure because J §23 acceptance explicitly named those behaviors. The checklist is evidence-first and authorizes no source change. Main may instead narrow closure explicitly and carry every missing gate as debt.

Use “Purchase registration”; “Purchase upsert” is unsupported.

## Host recovery

The selected Flutter SDK, Android SDK root, component versions, system image, and AVD are recorded in G/Record. Exact storage cost is unknown because it was not measured. Preserve the environment until the lifecycle supplement closes; cleanup requires inventory, explicit authority, and named-component removal.

## Authority and next route

No additional implementation is active. Read `04_TODO.md` for the lifecycle checklist and hygiene/recovery gates. If the checklist exposes a defect, stop for Main routing. After evidence closure, Main may close Sprint 05 and select the next objective.

## Recovery pointers

1. This checkpoint — compact current truth.
2. `04_TODO.md` — active lifecycle, hygiene, and recovery gates.
3. `12_OPERATIONAL_MODEL.md` — stable evidence/recovery rules.
4. Latest `11_OPERATIONAL_RECORD.md` entry — command and contradiction chronology.
5. G — Codex transcript; J §24 — Main classification; A/D — intended gates.

> Preparation: `DEV_STAGE/A_OPERATIONAL.md`

## Current classification

Implemented:

- responsive Purchase/Products/History shell;
- Product search/create and advisory existing/create-anyway paths;
- existing/new Store references;
- session-only keyed Purchase draft with edit/remove/review;
- safe product-facing loading/empty/error copy;
- detailed History and compatible same-Product price change;
- mounted-session in-flight submission guard;
- existing atomic Drift Purchase transaction.

Validated:

- 6 focused widget tests;
- format, 34 files unchanged;
- Flutter analysis, no issues;
- 31 Flutter tests;
- Windows release artifact build;
- 5 Python regressions.

Host-unvalidated:

- Android APK for this materialization: missing Java/`JAVA_HOME`;
- Android runtime and lifecycle;
- physical Android devices;
- iOS.

Blocked or defective:

- no manual Windows runtime smoke;
- phone-width long-form registration not covered;
- transient Product-success copy not asserted;
- existing-Product edit from the similarity-selection path does not reliably preserve its Product reference;
- tracked Python `__pycache__`/`.pyc` artifacts require bounded hygiene;
- busy-state duplicate prevention is not durable idempotency.

Deferred:

- Store identity hardening;
- export/restore and corruption recovery;
- performance budgets;
- production signing/distribution;
- authentication/API/Neon/synchronization;
- PySide6 retirement.

## Evidence boundary

Windows build success is not Windows manual acceptance. Android remains host-unvalidated rather than failed at product level. Automated width-specific coverage does not imply lifecycle or device acceptance.

## Authority and next route

No source correction, host mutation, or implementation is active. Read `04_TODO.md` for ordered gates. A bounded Main stage is required before correcting the existing-Product edit defect, repository hygiene, or host configuration.

# Intermid Cycle Recovery Operational Checkpoint

> Inspected implementation head: `409e5f1e013a282165efd5f31bed17a396ad6543`

> Preparation and authority: `DEV_STAGE/A_OPERATIONAL.md` + consumed `DEV_STAGE/D_OPS_STAGE.md`

## Current classification

Implemented:

- responsive local Purchase, Products, and History client;
- Drift schema v2 with app-private SQLite and persistent local Device identity;
- session-only multi-line Purchase draft, review, edit, remove, and in-flight submission guard;
- one local transaction for Store/Product resolution, Purchase, Items, device sequence, SyncEvent, and PendingEvent;
- detailed History and narrow compatible same-Product price comparison;
- corrected staged-line editing that retains the original Product reference and label while changing Item values.

Validated within the latest local Flutter evidence boundary:

- existing-Product edit retains the original Product ID;
- edited package count, quantity/unit, and line total persist through registration;
- no duplicate Product row is created;
- focused app widget suite: 7 passed;
- full Flutter suite: 32 passed;
- Flutter analysis: no issues.

The direct regression proves `ExistingProductReference`. Generic retention of the base `ProductReference`, including the new-Product variant, is source-implemented but not separately regression-validated.

## Evidence boundaries

Widget/in-memory evidence does not establish:

- app-private file-backed close/reopen or migration behavior;
- Windows manual runtime acceptance;
- Android build, install, runtime, lifecycle, or physical-device acceptance;
- iOS behavior;
- packaging, signing, release, distribution, backup, or restore acceptance.

The local SyncEvent/PendingEvent structures remain synchronization preparation only. The mounted-session submission guard is not durable idempotency.

## Corrected and superseded state

The existing-Product edit defect recorded in the prior Cycle 08 checkpoint is corrected and locally regression-validated at `409e5f1e013a282165efd5f31bed17a396ad6543`.

The prior active TODO for that correction is superseded. Historical defect and materialization chronology remain in `11_OPERATIONAL_RECORD.md`, A/D/G, J, and Git history.

## Host-unvalidated and unresolved

- current-host Flutter/Windows/Python command reproduction beyond the recorded local Codex run;
- Windows manual Purchase/Products/History and restart smoke;
- Android Java/JDK recovery, APK build, runtime, lifecycle, and physical device;
- iOS;
- phone-width long-form registration;
- file-backed restart and representative v1→v2 migration fixtures;
- transaction rollback failure injection;
- Catalogue/History performance budgets;
- tracked Python bytecode and ignore-policy hygiene.

## Deferred

- schema v3;
- Store identity/normalization;
- durable SubmissionId and retry semantics;
- installation–Device lifecycle changes;
- persistent drafts;
- export/restore and corruption recovery;
- authentication, API, Neon, upload/download, and multi-device convergence;
- production signing/distribution;
- PySide6 retirement.

## Authority and next route

No source, schema, host, staging, or Main-root change is active.

Next valid route:

```text
Main reconciles refreshed O/A/D checkpoints
→ selects one bounded remaining gate
→ controlling D/E/F
→ Codex materialization and evidence
→ renewed FLX-PRM-04 reconciliation
```
