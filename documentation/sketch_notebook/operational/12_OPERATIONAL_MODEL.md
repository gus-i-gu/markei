# 1. Purpose

This file defines stable Operational knowledge for Markei execution, packaging, persistence, diagnostics, installer production, and release validation. Current work belongs in `04_TODO.md`; current evidence state belongs in `10_OPERATIONAL_STATE.md`; chronology and artifact hashes belong in `11_OPERATIONAL_RECORD.md`.

# 2. Runtime and Persistence Boundary

Markei remains a local PySide6 desktop application backed by SQLite:

```text
main.py
→ app.main.main()
→ QApplication
→ MainWindow
→ Register / Lists / History / Settings
→ ProductService
→ Repository
→ app.core.database
→ SQLite
```

Writable user state and diagnostics remain external to replaceable application files:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%/Markei/market.sqlite
%LOCALAPPDATA%/Markei/logs/startup.log
```

A live database, WAL/SHM companions, logs, caches, tests, and sample fixtures are not valid production package or installer content.

# 3. Production Initialization Policy

The production package includes `app/database/schema.sql` and excludes `app/database/seed.sql`.

Fresh or compatible databases receive idempotent structural application defaults through database compatibility handling:

```text
category F / General
store 1 / Default Store
required settings defaults
```

These rows are required application structure, not demonstration business data. Production initialization must retain zero sample products and zero sample purchases. Structural defaults must be inserted without overwriting compatible user choices.

# 4. Packaging and Installer Authority

`Markei.spec` is the authoritative one-folder PyInstaller definition. `scripts/build_windows.ps1` is its invocation and clean-build wrapper; it must not redefine package composition independently.

`installer/Markei.iss` is the installer authority. `scripts/build_installer.ps1` locates and invokes Inno Setup; supported compiler discovery includes:

```text
explicit -ISCCPath
→ ISCC_PATH environment variable
→ per-user %LOCALAPPDATA%/Programs/Inno Setup 6/ISCC.exe
→ standard Program Files locations
```

Operational dependencies are phase-specific:

```text
build time      Python + PyInstaller + PySide6
runtime         frozen Markei distribution
installer time  Inno Setup / ISCC.exe
```

An installer-time dependency is not required by the installed application.

# 5. Evidence Ladder

Use these statuses precisely:

```text
configured
built
launched
installed
validated
accepted
blocked
unknown
```

The release ladder is:

```text
configuration materialized
→ frozen artifact built and inspected
→ frozen artifact launched
→ installer compiled and inspected
→ application installed
→ installed shortcut launch
→ technical workflow path validated
→ close/reopen and persistence validated
→ reinstall/uninstall/recovery validated
→ human-visible workflow and security observations
→ Main/human acceptance
```

Evidence from one gate does not prove a later gate. Automated ProductService/database evidence validates the technical workflow path but does not replace a human-visible UI walkthrough. Silent or programmatic execution does not establish human-visible SmartScreen behavior.

# 6. Installed Lifecycle Rules

The primary beta installer consumes the built one-folder distribution and installs per user under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Markei`, with a Start Menu shortcut and optional desktop shortcut. Writable state remains under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Markei`.

The accepted technical lifecycle route is:

```text
install
→ Start Menu launch
→ create and read application data
→ close and immediate reopen
→ same-version reinstall
→ uninstall while retaining user data
→ reinstall and recover retained compatible data
```

Validation may use the current ordinary Windows user only when existing data is backed up, test state is isolated sufficiently to avoid ambiguity, and the original state is restored. This proves ordinary per-user semantics; it does not prove dedicated-account isolation.

# 7. Startup and Shutdown Boundaries

The root executable entrypoint owns startup exception diagnostics. Unhandled startup exceptions must produce a failing process result, write an inspectable UTF-8 per-user log, and show a concise visible error when Qt permits.

Normal MainWindow composition owns final coordination of the four page-owned service/repository chains:

```text
MainWindow.closeEvent()
→ close Register, Lists, History, and Settings services idempotently
→ close repositories and SQLite connections
```

Stable correction rule:

```text
validate the lifecycle gate
→ classify the demonstrated failure
→ make the smallest bounded correction
→ rerun the failed and dependent gates
```

# 8. Database and Transaction Safety

Every Repository must have an identifiable owner and deterministic close path. Validation that initializes, migrates, resets, corrupts, or injects failure must protect ordinary user data and close all connections before cleanup.

Repository mutations commit individual persistence operations. Receipt registration and purchase deletion/recalculation remain non-atomic as complete workflows. Workflow atomicity is inherited Operational debt and is not resolved by successful packaging or installed-lifecycle validation.

# 9. Release Artifact Policy

Generated frozen distributions and installer executables are reproducible release outputs, not source truth. Operational policy is:

```text
source repository
    version packaging definitions, scripts, tests, and metadata

release evidence
    record artifact path, size, cryptographic hash, toolchain, and commands

release delivery
    publish binaries through an approved release/artifact channel
    do not retain generated binaries as ordinary source-controlled files
```

The current branch contains `dist/installer/Markei-Setup-0.1.0-x64.exe`, despite the Sprint 02 G report describing it as uncommitted. This is repository drift. Removing the binary and adding an ignore rule require a separately authorized repository-cleanup change; documentation reconciliation must not alter the artifact.

# 10. Non-Blocking Toolchain Debt

Inno Setup currently accepts `x64` while warning that it is deprecated in favor of `x64compatible`. The warning is non-blocking for the evidenced build but remains bounded installer-maintenance debt.

# 11. Acceptance Boundary

Technical installed-lifecycle validation does not grant beta acceptance. Final acceptance still requires human-visible installer and principal UI walkthrough evidence, normal close/reopen confirmation, human-visible SmartScreen or antivirus observations, and Main/human approval.

# 12. Shared-Client Synchronization Safety Rules

These rules are technology-independent and apply to any later shared-client implementation.

## 12.1 Privileged database credentials

Distributed clients must never contain privileged shared-database credentials. All shared reads and writes pass through an authenticated and authorized service boundary that validates account ownership, protocol version, payload, and operation.

## 12.2 Atomic local fact creation

When a user action creates local authoritative facts and an outbound synchronization event, the facts, event identity, queue state, and local ordering metadata must commit in one transaction:

```text
all durable together
or
none durable
```

A successful UI response must not leave authoritative facts without their required outbound event, or a queued event without its corresponding local facts.

## 12.3 Atomic downloaded-event application

Downloaded accepted events, applied-event identity records, affected authoritative facts, and the local server-cursor advancement must commit in one local transaction. The cursor must never advance beyond facts that were durably applied.

## 12.4 Unknown network outcomes

A lost response creates an unknown outcome, not a known failure. Clients retain pending work and retry with the same immutable event identity. The service must make identical retry safe and reject conflicting content under an already accepted identity.

## 12.5 Local proof before production infrastructure

Synchronization semantics, authorization isolation, transactions, retries, ordering/cursors, migrations, restart recovery, and diagnostics must first pass against disposable local infrastructure. Production or managed infrastructure is introduced only after the local protocol boundary is evidenced.

## 12.6 Migration rehearsal and recovery

Every supported migration path must be rehearsed against fresh state and representative prior state. A failed migration must preserve the prior valid state or a recoverable copy. Deployment and rollback procedures must define compatibility order, backups/recovery, diagnostics, and forward correction; destructive reversal is never assumed safe.

## 12.7 Accepted desktop-data isolation

New clients and experiments use distinct application-private storage and must not open, copy, mutate, or destructively convert accepted desktop user data without a separately authorized migration procedure. The accepted application and data remain recoverable until explicit parity and migration acceptance.

# 13. Canonical Maintenance Rule

Update this model only when stable Operational behavior or reusable validation rules change. Current hashes, command transcripts, temporary blockers, and chronological corrections belong in the record, checkpoint, or TODO.

> **Temporal boundary — Cycle 07 Sprint 02 closure (2026-07-12).** Content above this marker belongs to the preparation and first-reconciliation state established before Sprint 03 materialization. Content appended below it belongs to Sprint 03 or later. If recovery cost becomes excessive or this file grows beyond approximately 1,000 lines, this reviewed marker is an eligible semantic-partition boundary under human/Main authorization.
# Generated-Source and Cross-Platform Evidence Rules

## Generated-source ownership

Generated source is not reviewed as if every generated line were handwritten. Operational ownership is:

```text
review generator inputs, schema and configuration
→ pin generator/runtime dependencies
→ regenerate cleanly
→ verify no unexplained diff
→ run static analysis, tests and target builds
```

Committed lockfiles record resolved dependency state. Build outputs and local runtime databases remain excluded unless a separate artifact policy explicitly owns them.

## Target generation is not platform validation

Creating platform project directories proves only that scaffolding was generated. A platform claim requires its target host/toolchain, successful build, launch, lifecycle behavior, persistence behavior, and relevant packaged-plugin validation. Evidence from one platform does not validate another.

## Durable monotonic sequence rule

A per-device sequence used for synchronization must be allocated durably, must not reset during ordinary registration, and must be uniquely constrained within its account/device responsibility. Repeated-operation and recovery tests are required before ordering depends on it.

## Versioned canonical identity rule

When normalized identity affects stable identifiers across runtimes:

- display text remains separately preserved;
- normalization is explicitly versioned;
- Unicode, locale, whitespace, punctuation, dimension/unit, and canonical numeric rules are specified;
- fixed fixtures prove equivalent output across participating runtimes;
- rule changes require a migration policy rather than silent reinterpretation.

## Contract-example boundary

Human-readable JSON examples coordinate semantics but do not become a complete wire contract until required types, ranges, nullability, enums, unknown-field behavior, timestamp/decimal form, version compatibility, valid/invalid examples, and runtime validation are defined and tested.

# Sprint-Gated Host and Migration Rules

## Explicit host-mutation authority

Installing or modifying platform toolchains is a host mutation and requires an implementation stage that names the exact product, workload or component, permitted version boundary, invocation method, expected validation, failure handling, and stop condition. Planning acceptance alone is insufficient authority. Post-install evidence must distinguish tool presence, target detection, build success, launch success, and lifecycle validation.

## Identity-bearing migration safety

When a local schema introduces a user-facing code, normalized key, or new internal identity role, migration must preserve every existing primary/foreign-key relationship. Missing human-authored values may receive an explicitly temporary, account-unique bootstrap value, but migration must not invent product meaning. Temporary values remain identifiable for later review.

## Structural schema validation boundary

Executable schema validation proves payload structure only. Domain invariants, normalization equivalence, transaction behavior, cross-runtime semantic parity, and lifecycle persistence require separate tests. Readable valid and invalid examples remain part of the operational evidence set alongside the machine validator.

# Android Runtime Evidence and Host-Recovery Rules

## Gate-specific platform classification

Android evidence must be classified independently as:

```text
tool installed
doctor validated
runtime recognized
artifact built
artifact installed
process launched
workflow human-observed
app-private persistence observed
lifecycle matrix completed
physical-device validated
release/distribution validated
```

A later gate is never implied by an earlier one. Emulator execution does not prove physical-device compatibility; debug execution does not prove release signing, upgrade, backup, accessibility, or store distribution.

## Lifecycle checklist closure

When a stage's acceptance criteria name keyboard, Back, rotation, background/resume, text scale, process restart, or staged-state behavior, closure requires an explicit result for each named gate. Build, widget tests, database inspection, and a single manual workflow may establish partial lifecycle evidence but cannot silently stand in for the missing checklist. A supplemental checklist should remain evidence-only unless it exposes a bounded defect requiring separately authorized correction.

## SDK and AVD recovery

Installed SDK packages and virtual devices are reproducible host dependencies, not repository source. Operational evidence must record the selected Flutter SDK, Android SDK root, installed package identifiers/versions, system image, AVD definition, license state, and doctor result.

Recovery uses the recorded manifest and supported SDK/AVD tools. Cleanup requires separate authority, an inventory first, and named-component removal. Never delete an entire SDK root, unrelated AVDs, IDE configuration, or alternate Flutter SDK merely because one sprint no longer needs them. Host storage cost is reported from measured evidence; component type alone does not justify a numeric claim.

## Repository/report scope reconciliation

A materialization report's changed-file claim must be checked against the committed comparison. If repository truth contains an extra configuration file, preserve the contradiction observationally and classify ownership before cleanup. A harmless or generated-looking file is not automatically intentional, and a report statement does not override the commit.

## Workflow terminology

Operational reports name the executed domain operation. Current Markei behavior registers a new immutable Purchase aggregate. “Purchase upsert” is unsupported unless implementation explicitly provides update-or-insert semantics for Purchase identity.

# Cycle 08 Product-Beta Operational Rules

## Evidence separation for shared-client targets

For each target, classify independently:

```text
source implemented
→ automated tests validated
→ artifact built
→ process manually launched
→ principal workflow manually accepted
→ lifecycle matrix accepted
→ release/distribution accepted
```

A Windows release build does not establish manual Windows runtime acceptance. A failed Android build caused by a missing host Java configuration leaves Android host-unvalidated; it is not an application failure and does not validate the target.

## Presentation-path coverage rule

Responsive widget evidence must state which width and workflow were exercised. Shell/empty-state coverage at phone width does not validate a long scroll-form registration path unless that path is executed at the same constraints. Manual host smoke remains separately required.

## Session mitigation versus durable idempotency

Disabling submission while one mounted request is in flight prevents ordinary repeated taps only. It does not establish safe retry after restart, an unknown outcome, or two equivalent command instances. Durable idempotency requires an accepted identity, uniqueness, identical/conflicting retry rules, persistence, and restart/concurrency tests.

## Generated validation-artifact rule

Python `__pycache__` and `.pyc` files are generated runtime artifacts, not source. Validation must not intentionally publish them as implementation. If already tracked, repository truth and the materialization report must record them; cleanup and ignore-policy changes require a bounded authorized hygiene change rather than silent deletion during reconciliation.

## Existing-reference edit regression rule

When a draft line references an existing durable Product, editing presentation fields must preserve that reference unless the user explicitly chooses replacement. Tests must cover existing Product selection, edit, save, review, and registration without accidental conversion to an empty/new Product draft.

# Cycle 09 Local Expansion Operational Rules

## Schema-version transition gate

A local schema increment is accepted operationally only when fresh creation, every supported prior-version route, generated persistence code, representative file-backed migration, close/reopen, collision preflight and no-silent-reset behavior are named and tested. Migration evidence must state what was preserved, rewritten, backfilled or rejected. Host build success does not substitute for file-backed migration evidence.

## Optional historical-reference rule

Local organizational references such as Person and Payment Method must remain optional at every Purchase boundary. Absence must not block Product creation, drafting, registration, History, Lists or export. Archiving changes future selection availability without destroying historical label resolution. Credentials and payment secrets are prohibited from this metadata.

## Input-boundary normalization rule

User-facing numeric input may accept supported locale forms, but application/domain boundaries normalize to one locale-neutral representation before persistence. Tests must cover comma/point equivalence, unit/dimension mapping, canonical storage and invalid ambiguity. COUNT integrality is validated separately from MASS and VOLUME conversion.

## Exact lookup and collision evidence rule

Internal Product ID, visible Product code, exact normalized identity, advisory similarity and operation idempotency are independently evidenced. Exact code and identity paths require account-scoped repository tests. Similarity may warn but cannot prove lookup, collision resolution, merge safety or idempotency. UI claims require exercising the visible exact-lookup flow, not only repository ports.

## Typed-failure presentation rule

A typed application failure is operationally complete only when stable code, title, explanation, affected field/operation, recovery action, retryability and known/unknown outcome survive to user-facing presentation where applicable. Catch-all generic copy may protect internals but is only partial typed-error adoption. Error occurrences must not be silently exported, synchronized or retained as development analytics.

## Derived Lists evidence rule

Storage, Shortage, Market and All are rebuildable projections from Purchase/Product observations and a versioned algorithm. Tests must cover insufficient history, threshold boundaries, deterministic classification and invalidation after registration. Projections must not invent history or become authoritative List aggregates merely for UI convenience.

## Export/share separation rule

Export serialization, PDF-byte generation, file destination selection, local save, native share invocation and external transmission are separate gates. Deterministic selected-Purchase output does not prove a native share workflow. Export remains explicit, read-only and limited to selected data; no upload is implied.

## Accessibility and interaction completion rule

Ordinary tap/click, checkbox selection and keyboard-operable actions own accessibility acceptance. Double-click and long-press are optional conveniences and cannot be the sole route. A detail panel is not automatically an adaptive route; multi-selection does not imply select-all. Each promised affordance requires named widget or manual evidence.

## BULK purchase pricing gate

Nullable or absent package count establishes only the BULK package-count boundary. Completion additionally requires the accepted amount-bought and price-per-unit input semantics, deterministic rounding/total derivation and regression evidence. A Line total field alone must not be reported as completed price-per-unit behavior.

## Platform evidence restatement

Automated Flutter tests, Windows artifact build, bounded process launch, manual workflow, lifecycle behavior, Android build/runtime and release distribution remain independent claims. A missing Java host leaves Android host-unvalidated; it does not classify the Flutter implementation as failed.

# Cycle 09 Sprint 02 Operational Rules

People and Payment Methods retain opaque IDs plus Account-scoped immutable, transactional, non-reusing `@001...` / `#001...` codes. References remain optional, archives preserve `code · nickname`, and payment secrets are prohibited. Product codes are normalized, Account-scoped unique, non-null and immutable; legacy backfill must preserve relationships and pass migration/reopen gates.

Manual `dd/mm/yyyy` and `HH:mm` represent Purchase occurrence, distinct from insertion, and convert to UTC at the application boundary. Exact Product-code autofill does not add an Item. BULK derives a read-only fixed-point total from amount and rate in the same selected unit.

Catalogue click/tap selects and details remain explicit; History selection is checkbox/tap/keyboard owned, while double-click currently focuses detail. Lists language repair is not full relational/visual composition. Theme/components are infrastructure, not visual convergence. Oversized pages must be extracted before expansion.

Tests, analysis, migration, build, bounded launch, manual workflow, accessibility, lifecycle and release are separate gates. Windows build/hidden launch is not manual acceptance; absent Java leaves Android host-unvalidated; deterministic PDF/export is not native OS sharing.

---

# Cycle 10 Guarded Synchronization Operational Rules

The following reusable rules are promoted from `REC_LEGACY.md` Records 001–021 and Appendix I, with acceptance and deferral boundaries reconciled by the current `J_MAIN_STAGE.md` prefix §§2–5.

## Guarded execution route and ownership

The stable human-to-execution route is:

```text
GRM procedure
→ G_SCRIPTS guarded launcher
→ NS_COORDINATES non-secret selection
→ I_SCRIPTS implementation helper
→ client / Render / DB_MGMT evidence surface
→ REC chronological record
→ J sequence reconciliation
```

`DB_MGMT` owns bounded manual SQL management and explicitly read-only or rollback provider evidence. Runtime diagnostic definitions are owned by the registry; `ERR_DIAGNOSTICS.md` is its generated readable projection; REC owns sanitized assay chronology; J `Legacy_Progress` owns superseded sequence and corrective provenance. None is a substitute for another. Evidence: REC Appendix I; J §4 and `Legacy_Progress` GRIMOIRE/coordinate-system entries.

Before an authorized procedure, resolve the exact branch/head, verify required ancestry, identify the environment and Device/Account scope, freeze pre-action client and provider baselines where relevant, name the one permitted action, and state explicit stop conditions. Recheck the remote head before publication. Evidence: REC Records 009–017; J §5.2.

## Operation and projection separation

Readiness, ordinary Sync, Retry and Recovery are different operations:

- readiness proves only its bounded connection/configuration response;
- ordinary Sync owns upload, download, local apply, cursor and acknowledgement phases;
- Retry re-executes eligible queued work with the same durable identity;
- Recovery is separately authorized state repair/reconciliation and is never implied by failed readiness or a visible candidate.

Current action result, historical operation evidence and readiness projection must not overwrite one another. A current action outcome and the persistence of its diagnostic record are also separate outcomes. Evidence: REC Records 001–008 and 018–020.

A trusted server/provider response remains true when a later local apply, acknowledgement or diagnostic-persistence phase fails. Terminal projection must preserve the latest proved phase and classify later planes independently. Evidence: REC Records 019–020; J `Legacy_Progress` R03–R05 reconciliations.

## Evidence ladder and proof boundaries

Classify each surface independently:

```text
source implemented
→ automated tests validated
→ artifact built
→ client operation observed
→ Render/API request correlated
→ provider state reconciled
→ same-Device workflow accepted
→ reciprocal two-Device workflow accepted
→ production/lifecycle accepted
```

No rung implies a later rung. Correlate client, server and provider evidence by bounded time window and sanitized operation/correlation fingerprints; do not join them from order or similar wording alone. Provider counts require a named read-only/rollback procedure and cannot be inferred from client or Render success. Evidence: REC Records 001–003, 009–012, 017 and 021.

Same-Device proof establishes one Device's hosted round trip only. Two-Device proof requires both directions, stable identity mapping, matching projections, drained queues and separately bounded no-op/idempotency evidence. Two Devices on one Account do not prove multiple-Account isolation. Evidence: REC Records 011–017 and 021; J §§2–3.

Development acceptance never implies production acceptance. Every terminal must retain environment, Device count, Account count, provider-evidence time and any missing final recount. Evidence: REC Record 021 and Appendix I; J §3.

## Transaction, acknowledgement and diagnostic rules

Remote local application, affected facts, inbox/applied identity and cursor progress must commit before acknowledgement begins. If apply rolls back, acknowledgement remains not started. Diagnostic persistence may fail or degrade without changing the already-established transaction or trusted-response result; its own failure must remain visible. Evidence: REC Records 019–020; J `Legacy_Progress` R03–R05.

Natural Product identity convergence may merge equivalent remote/local references only under the implemented accepted identity rules. Observed human convergence does not generalize to untested ambiguity, conflicting code/identity, established UUID mutation or multiple-Account cases. Evidence: REC Records 018–021.

Diagnostic history is append-oriented. Runtime definitions begin in the registry and regenerate the readable projection; REC records sanitized operations; J retains historical investigation and sequence decisions. Do not duplicate the registry row-by-row into permanent Operational memory. Evidence: REC Appendix I; J §4.

## Safe stops and closure conditions

Stop before or during a guarded assay on branch/ancestry drift, ambiguous Device or Account binding, unexpected queue/cursor/sequence movement, timeout or unknown outcome outside the authorized packet, missing correlation, inconsistent provider counts, duplicate/missing Purchase or Product, unclassified local apply, or any required Retry/Recovery/provider mutation not separately authorized. Preserve the state and reconcile evidence before the next action. Evidence: REC Records 001–020 and J `Legacy_Progress` gate packets.

A bounded development closure may be accepted without a final provider recount only when that omission is explicit and the claim is limited to the client/Render evidence actually collected. It must not be restated as provider-final or production closure. Evidence: REC Record 021 assessment; J §3.

Deferred validation families remain distinct work: multiple-Account isolation; membership disablement and Device revocation; outage and acknowledgement-uncertainty recovery; retention, snapshot and rebootstrap; production deployment and lifecycle acceptance; GCM04 and any conditional R07 implementation. Evidence: REC Appendix I; J §§2–3 and §5.2.

# C11 Deterministic Local Analytics Operational Rules

These rules are promoted from `DEV_STAGE/G_OPS_CODEX.md`, `J_MAIN_STAGE.md` section 9, implementation commit `20e3d5f6c2f973d138e3b2680aa8adf96f17d0b6`, and the named Analytics source/tests.

## Complete local evidence-read boundary

A deterministic local analysis begins with one complete active-Account-predicated joined evidence read. A truncated History projection or per-Purchase detail loop is not Analytics query authority. Account filtering belongs in the repository query, not only in presentation filtering. Evidence: `local_analytics_repository.dart`, `local_analytics_repository_test.dart`, G request-count evidence and J §9.2–9.3.

Initial load issues one repository read; each explicit local Retry repeats exactly that read once. Filtering, row selection, calculation, card focus, reset, reorder and responsive recomposition operate on the loaded session dataset and must not issue repository requests. Retry is a local Analytics read, not protocol Retry, Sync or Recovery. Evidence: `analytics_workspace.dart`, `analytics_workspace_test.dart`, G and J §9.3.

## Bounded evidence and typed calculation

The evidence matrix may page presentation independently from the complete loaded calculation dataset. Stable row identity must survive filtering, selection and responsive layout. Selected scope is explicitly bounded, and History transfers typed Purchase IDs without calculating Analytics. Wide and compact presentations share one workspace state. Evidence: `analytics_workspace.dart`, `history_page.dart`, History handoff tests, G and J §9.2.

Analytics arithmetic remains checked fixed-point/rational. Quantity compatibility is enforced before calculation. Difference keeps explicit baseline-A/comparison-B ordering; Percentage uses a named part and containing whole. Zero denominators and overflow return typed unavailable results rather than wrapping, substituting floating-point behavior or repairing source facts. Evidence: `analytics_registry.dart`, `analytics_registry_test.dart`, G and J §9.2.

## Lifecycle, performance and acceptance gates

Hidden destinations must not start expensive local reads merely because their widgets exist in the retained shell. Visibility-gated loading and tester-owned bounded scrolling are lifecycle requirements when retained page state and native resources could keep tests unfinished. Evidence: `markei_app.dart`, `markei_app_test.dart`, G R02 evidence and J §9.4.

Performance claims must name fixture size, operation, rendered-page size, selected scope, host and measured load/calculation times. A passing Windows-host fixture is not a universal device guarantee. Automated tests, widget layout assertions, static analysis, platform builds, screenshots, assistive technology, keyboard use, real-device execution, locale review and human acceptance remain separate gates. Evidence: G ordinary/stress fixtures and evidence limits; J §9.3–9.5.

Local Analytics implementation and validation do not alter Sync, provider, production or Cycle 10 acceptance. No live operation or remote authority may be inferred from local analysis evidence. Evidence: G forbidden-surface audit and J §9.5.

# C11 Settings, Audit, and Closure Operational Rules

## Settings persistence and action boundaries

- Settings must load persisted Account-scoped preferences before presenting an editable value.
- Bounded numeric preferences must validate their complete accepted range before persistence and must preserve an invalid draft for correction.
- Local read, save and archive failures must remain distinct from empty and successful states.
- A successful reference archive must refresh the visible Account-scoped list.
- While one asynchronous Settings action is pending, duplicate actions must remain blocked.
- Local status refresh must remain distinct from actions that may contact a network or write local Auth, Device or Sync state. Capability-narrow adapters must expose those effects explicitly.

## Ordinary Audit read boundary

- Ordinary Audit is a sanitized, local, read-only projection for one Account and environment; it is not Purchase History, current System Health, hosted observability or Sync authority.
- One Audit page is bounded to one attempt query and one child-event query. Ordinary load and local Retry must perform zero Audit network calls and zero Audit writes.
- Account and environment predicates apply before projection. Child events are restricted to the selected attempt identities.
- Paging uses persisted identity and an exclusive composite cursor of UTC start time plus attempt ID. The default page is bounded and callers cannot exceed the hard maximum.
- Audit states must distinguish loading, ready, empty, stale, bounded-window and unavailable meaning.
- Audit projection must exclude credentials, tokens, raw payloads, SQL, filesystem paths, stack traces, private URLs, full hashes, raw identifiers and raw exceptions.
- Audit lifecycle must visibility-gate its initial read, suppress stale completions and become inert after disposal.
- Broad Closure, Auth mutation, enrollment, Sync, protocol Retry, Recovery and delete-history capabilities must remain outside ordinary Audit.

## Closure retirement and evidence gates

- Closure is not an ordinary product destination under either development-flag value.
- Retained Closure pages, runners and diagnostics are development/support implementation only while unreachable from ordinary navigation; their existence does not establish product acceptance.
- Composition owns idempotent disposal of the Audit controller and local database.
- Automated tests, analysis and platform builds establish only their named execution boundary. Screenshot, assistive-technology, locale, real-device and keyboard-only acceptance require separate evidence.
- Bounded human UI acceptance may close the implemented phase while explicitly deferring non-blocking visual refinements; it must not silently establish unperformed accessibility or platform gates.
