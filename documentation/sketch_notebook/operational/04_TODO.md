# 1. Fast Recovery Card

```text
Flutter/Dart client basis: accepted for planning
TypeScript API: favored
Neon Postgres: favored
Sprint 02 planning/restaging/reconciliation: complete
experiment dependencies: provisional
implementation: not authorized
D/E/F: postponed
next target: Sprint 03 evidence preparation
```

# 2. P0 — Reproducible Environments

Before implementation authorization, specify and pin:

- Flutter channel/SDK and Dart versions;
- `pubspec.lock` policy and generated-code reproducibility;
- Visual Studio C++/Windows SDK requirements;
- Android SDK, build-tools, JDK, ADB, emulator image and physical-device expectations;
- TypeScript, Node, package manager and lockfile;
- disposable Postgres version and migration runner;
- later macOS/Xcode/iOS version boundary.

Capture clean-environment verification commands and failure classifications. Do not install them during this documentation phase.

# 3. P0 — Canonical Cross-Language Fixtures

Define versioned Dart/TypeScript JSON fixtures for:

- catalogue normalization and deterministic identity;
- PACKAGED versus BULK products;
- within-dimension unit equivalence;
- similarity warning without automatic merge;
- Purchase with one and multiple Purchase Items;
- currency and integer minor units;
- event envelope, UUID, device sequence, account cursor and stable errors;
- projection output;
- analytic identifier/version/result.

Specify nullability, enums, canonical decimal serialization, timestamp roles, unknown-field policy, protocol/schema versions, and semantic equality rules.

# 4. P0 — Local Persistence Comparison

Evaluate Drift first and retain `sqflite_common_ffi` as comparison. Required gates:

- fresh application-private database;
- schema creation and foreign keys;
- uniqueness for exact normalized identities;
- transactions and rollback;
- ordered migrations from representative prior schemas;
- release-mode native-library packaging;
- close/reopen after process termination;
- two isolated device stores;
- deterministic projection rebuild.

Candidate selection remains provisional until Windows and Android packaged evidence passes.

# 5. P0 — Secure Credential Storage

Evaluate the secure-storage candidate on Windows and Android for:

- create/read/update/delete;
- locked-device and unavailable-store failures where applicable;
- token rotation and logout deletion;
- corrupted entry recovery;
- application upgrade;
- backup/restore behavior;
- reinstall/uninstall behavior;
- secret redaction in logs.

Repeat on iOS only after macOS/Xcode becomes available. Do not describe package platform metadata as validation.

# 6. P0 — Atomic Local Purchase and Event

Prove in one local transaction:

```text
catalogue resolution/create
+ Purchase
+ one or more Purchase Items
+ pending purchase.registered event
+ device sequence allocation
```

Inject failure at each boundary. Pass only when all facts persist together or none do. The ordinary Cycle 06 database must remain unreachable and unchanged.

# 7. P0 — Local TypeScript Protocol Harness

Prepare a local TypeScript API with fake/test account identities and disposable Postgres. Required protocol gates:

- identical retry returns prior acceptance without duplicate;
- conflicting content under the same event UUID is rejected;
- device-sequence gap is rejected and missing sequence requested;
- cursor download is ordered and account-scoped;
- download event application and cursor advancement commit together locally;
- second device bootstraps from cursor zero in bounded pages;
- API/Postgres restart preserves accepted events/cursors;
- cross-account read/write is denied;
- malformed/version-incompatible events produce stable errors;
- request/batch/event correlation logs redact credentials and sensitive data.

# 8. P1 — Platform Evidence

Windows and Android evidence must include clean build, debug/release-relevant launch, local persistence, lifecycle/process-kill reopen, secure storage, fixture parity, protocol interaction, artifact diagnostics, and Cycle 06 isolation.

iOS remains a later independent gate requiring macOS/Xcode, Simulator/device, plugin validation, signing boundary, and the same persistence/security/protocol tests.

# 9. P1 — Neon Advancement Gate

Advance from disposable Postgres to a non-production Neon environment only after local protocol and migration gates pass. Then test TLS, roles, pooled application versus direct migration connections, cold start, transient failure, quotas, logs, migration rehearsal, rollback/recovery, and strict environment separation.

Neon remains favored, not validated or provisioned.

# 10. Completion Boundary

Sprint 03 preparation is ready for Main when the environment manifest, fixtures, validation matrices, failure injections, migration/rollback route, isolation assertions, and stop conditions can be converted into one bounded D/E/F unit.

Until then:

```text
no source implementation
no tool installation
no databases
no external accounts or infrastructure
no D/E/F
```

# Cycle 07 Sprint 05 — Remaining Operational Gates

## P0 — Supplemental Android lifecycle checklist

Run on the existing `Markei_Sprint05_API36` emulator with controlled data and without clearing app data:

- confirm the Purchase form remains usable with the keyboard open and closed;
- confirm focused/invalid fields remain visible;
- record Android Back behavior from Purchase and History;
- rotate portrait→landscape→portrait and record committed and unsaved staged state;
- background/resume and verify no duplicate or partial registration;
- test at least default and enlarged text scale for blocking overflow;
- register a controlled Purchase, confirm History, force-stop/terminate, relaunch, and confirm History again;
- register a second Purchase and verify the same Device UUID and monotonic sequence;
- record pass/fail, human-observed versus tool-observed evidence, screenshots/log references where permitted, and any bounded defect.

A source correction is not authorized by this checklist alone. If a failure requires code, stop and route a bounded Main patch.

## P0 — Close the evidence wording

- use “Purchase registration,” never “Purchase upsert,” unless update-or-insert behavior is later implemented;
- distinguish phone-width widget coverage from Android lifecycle evidence;
- distinguish database-row persistence from human-visible History-after-restart;
- retain emulator-only and debug-only qualifications.

## P1 — DevTools configuration disposition

Main/human must decide one later hygiene action for `clients/markei_flutter/devtools_options.yaml`:

1. retain and document it as intentional shared DevTools configuration; or
2. remove it and, if appropriate, ignore future local generation.

Do not alter it during permanent reconciliation. Any hygiene commit must inspect whether editor/DevTools workflows regenerate it and must update G-style scope reporting accurately.

## P1 — Host recovery and storage inventory

Before cleanup or reproduction, record:

```text
selected Flutter SDK revision
Android SDK root
installed SDK package list
AVD list and definition
license/doctor result
measured SDK, AVD, Gradle-cache, and build-output sizes
```

Preserve the current SDK and AVD until lifecycle evidence closes. Later cleanup must be separately authorized and remove only named SDK packages/AVDs through supported tools. Do not delete `C:\Users\gusrm\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk`, alternate Flutter clones, unrelated AVDs, or IDE settings wholesale.

## Deferred validation

- physical Android device;
- additional emulator/API/device classes;
- Android release build and production signing;
- install/upgrade/backup/restore/data-clear lifecycle;
- formal accessibility and final visual acceptance;
- Play Store;
- iOS;
- authentication, API, Postgres/Neon, and real synchronization.

## Closure boundary

Sprint 05 can close as Android debug-development parity only after the supplemental lifecycle checklist is recorded or Main explicitly narrows acceptance with the remaining items carried as named debt. Physical-device and release evidence remain later gates either way.

# Cycle 08 C08-PB-01 — Remaining Operational Gates

## P0 — Existing-Product edit defect

Route a bounded source/test correction for the existing-Product draft edit path:

- reproduce through similar-Product “Use this Product”;
- edit the staged line;
- preserve `ExistingProductReference`;
- save, review, and register;
- assert no empty/new Product draft is created;
- rerun focused and complete Flutter suites.

## P0 — Host validation

1. Configure or recover the approved Java/JDK environment without installing or deleting tools implicitly.
2. Rerun `flutter build apk --debug`; keep Android host-unvalidated until it passes.
3. Perform a manual Windows release launch and Purchase/Products/History smoke.
4. Run Android launch and lifecycle checks only after a successful artifact build and recognized target.
5. Preserve automated, build, manual runtime, lifecycle, and physical-device classifications separately.

## P0 — Widget-path completion

Add or extend evidence for:

- phone-width long-form Purchase registration;
- existing Product edit/save path;
- transient Product-creation success copy;
- loading/empty/error/retry states;
- draft retention across destination changes;
- larger text, keyboard/focus, overflow, and Back behavior.

## P1 — Repository hygiene

In a separate authorized commit:

- inventory tracked `__pycache__` and `.pyc`;
- confirm they are generated;
- remove only those artifacts;
- add/verify ignore policy;
- rerun Python regressions;
- verify no handwritten or user-data file is removed.

## P1 — Product-beta hardening

Still required:

- bounded Catalogue/History volume and query-cost evidence;
- migration-failure/no-silent-reset recovery;
- export/restore decision and restore evidence if called backup;
- Store duplicate/identity policy;
- durable idempotency decision;
- Device-installation relation timing;
- Windows/Android manual acceptance matrix.

## Deferred

Authentication/API/Neon/synchronization, iOS, production signing/distribution, physical-device breadth, PySide6 retirement, forecasting, and broad analytics remain deferred.

## Next route

```text
Operational/Didactic/Design permanent reconciliation
→ Main evidence reconciliation
→ bounded defect/host-validation staging if authorized
→ Codex correction and G/H/I
→ renewed PDR2
```
