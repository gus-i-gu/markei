4. DEV_TRACK/01_OPERATIONAL.md update

This update already exists in the repository. It records the same diagnosis: services.py imports Repository, but repository.py does not define an importable Repository class; methods are nested under if __name__ == "__main__":; and the recommended fix is to restore the class boundary and move methods into it.

Current staged operational entry:

## 2026-07-07 — Operational Diagnosis: Repository ImportError

### Trigger

Runtime error:

ImportError: cannot import name 'Repository' from 'app.core.repository'

### Suspected Cause

app/core/services.py imports Repository from app.core.repository and instantiates it inside ProductService.__init__, but app/core/repository.py does not currently define an importable Repository class.

The repository file appears structurally corrupted or partially overwritten:
- It begins directly with database connection functions.
- Required imports are absent from the visible top of the file.
- Repository-style product and purchase methods are nested under if __name__ == "__main__" instead of inside class Repository.
- Therefore from .repository import Repository fails during module import.

### Operational Classification

This is not primarily a business-logic bug. It is a module/class boundary failure caused by repository structure drift.

### Status

Staged for Codex implementation.

I would keep that entry, but change the final status after patching to:

### Status

Implementation required in `app/core/repository.py`.

Next operational step:
restore `Repository` as a module-scope class, move persistence methods into it, fix `cursor_execute`, and validate imports before running the UI.

The attached CS & Coding methodology emphasizes that debugging should expose architectural reasoning and that knowledge should precede modification, which fits this diagnosis: first identify the broken layer boundary, then patch.

TASK INVESTIGATED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Runtime error under investigation:

```text
ImportError: cannot import name 'Repository' from 'app.core.repository'
```

Primary source files inspected:

- `app/core/repository.py`
- `app/core/services.py`
- `app/core/contracts.py`
- `app/core/database.py`
- `app/core/models.py`

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FINDINGS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 1. Immediate suspected cause

`app/core/services.py` imports `Repository` from `app.core.repository`:

```python
from .repository import Repository
```

and instantiates it inside `ProductService.__init__`:

```python
self.repository = Repository()
```

However, `app/core/repository.py` does not currently expose a module-level `Repository` class.

The file begins with database connection functions such as `connect`, `close`, and `reset`, without the expected repository imports or class declaration.

A large block of repository-like methods appears indented under:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
```

This means those `def create_product`, `def update_product`, `def get_products`, etc. definitions are not class methods and are not exported as `Repository`.

Therefore Python can import the module file, but cannot find a symbol named `Repository` inside it.

## 2. Secondary structural issue

`app/core/repository.py` appears partially corrupted or accidentally overwritten with content from `database.py`.

Evidence:

- `repository.py` starts with database lifecycle functions rather than repository class setup.
- `database.py` already owns the database lifecycle responsibilities.
- `services.py` documentation expects this architecture:

```text
ProductService
        ↓
Repository
        ↓
SQLite
```

but the repository implementation is not currently shaped as a repository object.

## 3. Contract mismatch

`app/core/contracts.py` defines `RepositoryContract`, including abstract methods such as:

- `create_product`
- `update_product`
- `delete_product`
- `insert_purchase`
- `delete_purchase`
- `get_product`
- `get_products`
- `get_purchases`

`app/core/repository.py` should likely define:

```python
class Repository(RepositoryContract):
    ...
```

or at minimum:

```python
class Repository:
    ...
```

but no such class exists in the inspected file.

## 4. Additional implementation risks discovered

Even after adding a `Repository` class wrapper, the file likely has follow-up runtime errors:

### 4.1 Missing or misplaced initialization

A working repository probably needs:

```python
self.connection = connect()
self.cursor = self.connection.cursor()
```

inside `Repository.__init__`.

### 4.2 Missing commit / close helpers

Several methods call:

```python
self.commit()
self.close()
```

but no confirmed module-level class methods for `commit` or `close` were observed in the inspected repository excerpt.

### 4.3 `cursor_execute` recursion bug

The observed `cursor_execute` implementation calls itself:

```python
return self.cursor_execute(sql, parameters)
```

This would cause infinite recursion once repository methods are actually invoked.

It should likely call:

```python
return self.cursor.execute(sql, parameters)
```

### 4.4 Row mapper dependency risk

Several methods call row conversion helpers such as:

```python
self.row_to_product(...)
self.row_to_purchase(...)
self.row_to_category(...)
self.row_to_store(...)
self.row_to_promotion(...)
```

Those helpers must exist as methods on `Repository`, or the next runtime failure will be `AttributeError` after the import error is fixed.

### 4.5 Model/schema alignment risk

The current models include `Category`, `Store`, `Product`, and `Purchase`.

Repository methods also refer to `Promotion`, but the inspected `models.py` excerpt did not confirm a `Promotion` dataclass.

If `Promotion` is not defined elsewhere, repository reconstruction must either remove promotion methods for MVP or add/import the correct model only if design approves it.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
OPERATIONAL DIAGNOSIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The import error is not caused by Python path resolution alone.

The direct cause is that `app/core/repository.py` does not define/export `Repository`.

The deeper operational cause is likely an incomplete or malformed repository refactor: repository behaviour exists as loose or wrongly-indented functions, while `ProductService` expects an instantiable repository object.

This is a source-structure failure, not a database-data failure.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PROPOSED ACTIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Minimal patch plan

Patch only after Main Chat synthesis and Codex/materialization instruction.

1. Rebuild `app/core/repository.py` around a module-level `Repository` class.
2. Import required dependencies at the top:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from .contracts import RepositoryContract
from .database import connect, close as close_connection
from .models import Category, Product, Purchase, Store
```

3. Define:

```python
class Repository(RepositoryContract):
```

4. Add `__init__`:

```python
def __init__(self):
    self.connection = connect()
    self.cursor = self.connection.cursor()
```

5. Move the existing SQL methods inside the class, outside `if __name__ == "__main__"`.
6. Add working helpers:

```python
def cursor_execute(self, sql, parameters=()):
    return self.cursor.execute(sql, parameters)

def commit(self):
    self.connection.commit()

def close(self):
    close_connection(self.connection)
```

7. Add or verify row mapper methods for every returned model:

- `row_to_product`
- `row_to_purchase`
- `row_to_category`
- `row_to_store`

8. Defer `Promotion` support unless the model and schema are confirmed present.
9. Keep `database.py` responsible only for database creation/configuration/connection.
10. Keep `services.py` unchanged initially, because its import expectation is architecturally correct.

## Exact files to inspect before patching

Required:

- `app/core/repository.py`
- `app/core/services.py`
- `app/core/contracts.py`
- `app/core/models.py`
- `app/core/database.py`
- `database/schema.sql`

Optional but useful:

- `app/ui/pages/register_page.py`
- `app/ui/pages/storage_page.py`
- `app/ui/pages/history_page.py`
- `app/main.py`

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
COMMANDS / TESTS REQUIRED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

After patching, run in repository root:

```bash
python -m compileall app
```

Import smoke test:

```bash
python -c "from app.core.repository import Repository; print(Repository)"
```

Service smoke test:

```bash
python -c "from app.core.services import ProductService; service = ProductService(); print(type(service.repository)); service.close()"
```

Repository read smoke test:

```bash
python -c "from app.core.repository import Repository; repo = Repository(); print(repo.count_products()); repo.close()"
```

Application boot test:

```bash
python -m app.main
```

If package entrypoint is configured:

```bash
python -m app
```

No commands were run in this session because the available interface was GitHub file inspection/editing, not a local runtime shell.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
IMPLEMENTATION RISKS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Fixing only the missing class name may expose the recursive `cursor_execute` bug immediately.
2. Fixing `cursor_execute` may expose missing `row_to_*` mapper methods.
3. Adding mappers may expose schema/model naming mismatches.
4. Promotion-related repository methods may refer to undefined models or tables.
5. The current `RepositoryContract` is narrower than the full repository method set; extra methods may be acceptable, but contract coverage should remain coherent.
6. If `app/core/repository.py` was accidentally overwritten, reconstructing it manually risks losing intended methods unless old commit history is inspected.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
REMAINING UNCERTAINTIES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- Whether `CHAT_BEHAVIOUR.md` and `CHAT_PROTOCOL.md` are missing, renamed, or not committed yet.
- Whether `04_TODO.md` and `10_ACTIONS.md` were intentionally retired after the DEV_STAGE migration.
- Whether a previous correct version of `app/core/repository.py` exists in Git history and should be restored instead of manually rebuilt.
- Whether `Promotion` is part of the current MVP schema/model set or leftover planned functionality.
- Whether `app/core/__init__.py` is intentionally absent.

SESSION CONTINUATION | LOCAL MERGE RECOVERY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Local state reported by user

```text
git status

On branch main
Your branch and 'origin/main' have diverged,
and have 1 and 2 different commits each, respectively.

You have unmerged paths.

Unmerged paths:
        both added:      documentation/sketch_notebook/DEV_STAGE/A_OPERATIONAL.md
        both added:      documentation/sketch_notebook/DEV_STAGE/C_DESIGN.md

no changes added to commit
```

## Operational diagnosis

The local repository is currently in the middle of a merge conflict.

Both local `main` and remote `origin/main` independently added the same DEV_STAGE files:

- `documentation/sketch_notebook/DEV_STAGE/A_OPERATIONAL.md`
- `documentation/sketch_notebook/DEV_STAGE/C_DESIGN.md`

This is a `both added` conflict, not a normal line-level edit conflict.

Operational meaning:

- Git does not know whether to keep the local version, the remote version, or a manually combined version.
- No new operational source-code work should happen until this merge is resolved.
- The local branch has one commit not present on remote.
- The remote branch has two commits not present locally.
- The local working tree must be cleaned before further patching or source commits.

## Important authority boundary

Operational Chat may stage/write only:

```text
documentation/sketch_notebook/DEV_STAGE/A_OPERATIONAL.md
```

Operational Chat must not resolve or rewrite `C_DESIGN.md` semantically.

For `C_DESIGN.md`, the safe operational instruction is to preserve both versions or defer semantic resolution to Design/Main Chat.

## Recommended recovery path

Preferred path: resolve the merge manually, preserve both stage-file contributions, then create a merge commit.

Do not use `git push --force`.

Do not delete either side blindly.

Do not continue repository implementation work until `git status` is clean.

## Step-by-step commands

### 1. Inspect the conflicted files

```bash
git status

git diff -- documentation/sketch_notebook/DEV_STAGE/A_OPERATIONAL.md

git diff -- documentation/sketch_notebook/DEV_STAGE/C_DESIGN.md
```

### 2. Open both conflicted files in VS Code

```bash
code documentation/sketch_notebook/DEV_STAGE/A_OPERATIONAL.md
code documentation/sketch_notebook/DEV_STAGE/C_DESIGN.md
```

Each conflicted file will likely contain conflict markers:


### 3. Resolve `A_OPERATIONAL.md`

For `A_OPERATIONAL.md`, keep both operational entries sequentially.

Recommended order:

1. Keep the local operational content first if it was created earlier locally.
2. Keep the remote operational content after it if it was created later remotely.
3. Remove all conflict markers:


4. Ensure the final file is valid Markdown and reads as consecutive operational notes.

If unsure which side is local or remote, inspect with:

```bash
git show :2:documentation/sketch_notebook/DEV_STAGE/A_OPERATIONAL.md

git show :3:documentation/sketch_notebook/DEV_STAGE/A_OPERATIONAL.md
```

In an unmerged file:

- `:2:` is usually `ours` / local `HEAD`.
- `:3:` is usually `theirs` / incoming remote side.

### 4. Resolve `C_DESIGN.md` conservatively

Because this is outside Operational Chat semantic authority, do not rewrite its design content.

Recommended safe options:

Option A — preserve both versions sequentially:

```bash
git show :2:documentation/sketch_notebook/DEV_STAGE/C_DESIGN.md > C_DESIGN.local.tmp

git show :3:documentation/sketch_notebook/DEV_STAGE/C_DESIGN.md > C_DESIGN.remote.tmp
```

Then manually combine them into:

```text
documentation/sketch_notebook/DEV_STAGE/C_DESIGN.md
```

with clear separators such as:

```text
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
LOCAL DESIGN STAGE VERSION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

...

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
REMOTE DESIGN STAGE VERSION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

...
```

Option B — stop and ask Main/Design Chat before resolving `C_DESIGN.md`.

Use Option B if the two design versions contradict each other or appear to represent different design decisions.

### 5. Mark conflicts as resolved

After editing both files and removing all conflict markers:

```bash
git add documentation/sketch_notebook/DEV_STAGE/A_OPERATIONAL.md

git add documentation/sketch_notebook/DEV_STAGE/C_DESIGN.md
```

### 6. Verify there are no remaining conflict markers

```bash
git diff --check

git status
```

Optional direct marker search in PowerShell:

```powershell
Select-String -Path documentation/sketch_notebook/DEV_STAGE/A_OPERATIONAL.md, documentation/sketch_notebook/DEV_STAGE/C_DESIGN.md -Pattern '<<<<<<<|=======|>>>>>>>'
```

If this prints anything, conflict markers remain and must be removed before committing.

### 7. Complete the merge commit

```bash
git commit
```

Use the default merge message, or:

```bash
git commit -m "Merge remote DEV_STAGE updates"
```

### 8. Push after the merge commit succeeds

```bash
git push origin main
```

### 9. Confirm clean state

```bash
git status
```

Expected final result:

```text
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## Alternative recovery path if the merge should be abandoned

If the current merge attempt is too confused and no manual conflict work should be kept:

```bash
git merge --abort
```

Then inspect the branch situation again:

```bash
git status

git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all -n 10
```

Then retry integration explicitly:

```bash
git pull --no-rebase origin main
```

This will likely recreate the same conflicts, but from a cleaner merge state.

## Commands not recommended here

Avoid:

```bash
git push --force
```

because it may overwrite the remote functional-stage commits.

Avoid:

```bash
git reset --hard origin/main
```

unless the local-only commit is known to be disposable.

Avoid:

```bash
git checkout --ours documentation/sketch_notebook/DEV_STAGE/C_DESIGN.md
```

or:

```bash
git checkout --theirs documentation/sketch_notebook/DEV_STAGE/C_DESIGN.md
```

unless Main/Design Chat explicitly decides which side should win.

## Validation after recovery

After the merge is resolved and pushed, run:

```bash
git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all -n 10

git status
```

Then continue with the repository import-error patch only after Main Chat synthesis.
