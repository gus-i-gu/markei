4. DEV_TRACK/01_OPERATIONAL.md update

This update already exists in the repository. It records the same diagnosis: services.py imports Repository, but repository.py does not define an importable Repository class; methods are nested under if __name__ == "__main__":; and the recommended fix is to restore the class boundary and move methods into it.

Current staged operational entry:

## 2026-07-07 — Operational Diagnosis: Repository ImportError

### Trigger

Runtime error:

ImportError: cannot import name 'Repository' from 'app.core.repository'

### Suspected Cause

app/core/services.py imports Repository from app.core.repository and instantiates it inside ProductService.__init__, but app/core/repository.py does not currently define an importable Repository class.

The repository file appears structurally corrupted or partially overwritten:
- It begins directly with database connection functions.
- Required imports are absent from the visible top of the file.
- Repository-style product and purchase methods are nested under if __name__ == "__main__" instead of inside class Repository.
- Therefore from .repository import Repository fails during module import.

### Operational Classification

This is not primarily a business-logic bug. It is a module/class boundary failure caused by repository structure drift.

### Status

Staged for Codex implementation.

I would keep that entry, but change the final status after patching to:

### Status

Implementation required in `app/core/repository.py`.

Next operational step:
restore `Repository` as a module-scope class, move persistence methods into it, fix `cursor_execute`, and validate imports before running the UI.

The attached CS & Coding methodology emphasizes that debugging should expose architectural reasoning and that knowledge should precede modification, which fits this diagnosis: first identify the broken layer boundary, then patch.

TASK INVESTIGATED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Runtime error under investigation:

```text
ImportError: cannot import name 'Repository' from 'app.core.repository'
```

Primary source files inspected:

- `app/core/repository.py`
- `app/core/services.py`
- `app/core/contracts.py`
- `app/core/database.py`
- `app/core/models.py`

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FINDINGS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 1. Immediate suspected cause

`app/core/services.py` imports `Repository` from `app.core.repository`:

```python
from .repository import Repository
```

and instantiates it inside `ProductService.__init__`:

```python
self.repository = Repository()
```

However, `app/core/repository.py` does not currently expose a module-level `Repository` class.

The file begins with database connection functions such as `connect`, `close`, and `reset`, without the expected repository imports or class declaration.

A large block of repository-like methods appears indented under:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
```

This means those `def create_product`, `def update_product`, `def get_products`, etc. definitions are not class methods and are not exported as `Repository`.

Therefore Python can import the module file, but cannot find a symbol named `Repository` inside it.

## 2. Secondary structural issue

`app/core/repository.py` appears partially corrupted or accidentally overwritten with content from `database.py`.

Evidence:

- `repository.py` starts with database lifecycle functions rather than repository class setup.
- `database.py` already owns the database lifecycle responsibilities.
- `services.py` documentation expects this architecture:

```text
ProductService
        ↓
Repository
        ↓
SQLite
```

but the repository implementation is not currently shaped as a repository object.

## 3. Contract mismatch

`app/core/contracts.py` defines `RepositoryContract`, including abstract methods such as:

- `create_product`
- `update_product`
- `delete_product`
- `insert_purchase`
- `delete_purchase`
- `get_product`
- `get_products`
- `get_purchases`

`app/core/repository.py` should likely define:

```python
class Repository(RepositoryContract):
    ...
```

or at minimum:

```python
class Repository:
    ...
```

but no such class exists in the inspected file.

## 4. Additional implementation risks discovered

Even after adding a `Repository` class wrapper, the file likely has follow-up runtime errors:

### 4.1 Missing or misplaced initialization

A working repository probably needs:

```python
self.connection = connect()
self.cursor = self.connection.cursor()
```

inside `Repository.__init__`.

### 4.2 Missing commit / close helpers

Several methods call:

```python
self.commit()
self.close()
```

but no confirmed module-level class methods for `commit` or `close` were observed in the inspected repository excerpt.

### 4.3 `cursor_execute` recursion bug

The observed `cursor_execute` implementation calls itself:

```python
return self.cursor_execute(sql, parameters)
```

This would cause infinite recursion once repository methods are actually invoked.

It should likely call:

```python
return self.cursor.execute(sql, parameters)
```

### 4.4 Row mapper dependency risk

Several methods call row conversion helpers such as:

```python
self.row_to_product(...)
self.row_to_purchase(...)
self.row_to_category(...)
self.row_to_store(...)
self.row_to_promotion(...)
```

Those helpers must exist as methods on `Repository`, or the next runtime failure will be `AttributeError` after the import error is fixed.

### 4.5 Model/schema alignment risk

The current models include `Category`, `Store`, `Product`, and `Purchase`.

Repository methods also refer to `Promotion`, but the inspected `models.py` excerpt did not confirm a `Promotion` dataclass.

If `Promotion` is not defined elsewhere, repository reconstruction must either remove promotion methods for MVP or add/import the correct model only if design approves it.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
OPERATIONAL DIAGNOSIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The import error is not caused by Python path resolution alone.

The direct cause is that `app/core/repository.py` does not define/export `Repository`.

The deeper operational cause is likely an incomplete or malformed repository refactor: repository behaviour exists as loose or wrongly-indented functions, while `ProductService` expects an instantiable repository object.

This is a source-structure failure, not a database-data failure.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PROPOSED ACTIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Minimal patch plan

Patch only after Main Chat synthesis and Codex/materialization instruction.

1. Rebuild `app/core/repository.py` around a module-level `Repository` class.
2. Import required dependencies at the top:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from .contracts import RepositoryContract
from .database import connect, close as close_connection
from .models import Category, Product, Purchase, Store
```

3. Define:

```python
class Repository(RepositoryContract):
```

4. Add `__init__`:

```python
def __init__(self):
    self.connection = connect()
    self.cursor = self.connection.cursor()
```

5. Move the existing SQL methods inside the class, outside `if __name__ == "__main__"`.
6. Add working helpers:

```python
def cursor_execute(self, sql, parameters=()):
    return self.cursor.execute(sql, parameters)

def commit(self):
    self.connection.commit()

def close(self):
    close_connection(self.connection)
```

7. Add or verify row mapper methods for every returned model:

- `row_to_product`
- `row_to_purchase`
- `row_to_category`
- `row_to_store`

8. Defer `Promotion` support unless the model and schema are confirmed present.
9. Keep `database.py` responsible only for database creation/configuration/connection.
10. Keep `services.py` unchanged initially, because its import expectation is architecturally correct.

## Exact files to inspect before patching

Required:

- `app/core/repository.py`
- `app/core/services.py`
- `app/core/contracts.py`
- `app/core/models.py`
- `app/core/database.py`
- `database/schema.sql`

Optional but useful:

- `app/ui/pages/register_page.py`
- `app/ui/pages/storage_page.py`
- `app/ui/pages/history_page.py`
- `app/main.py`

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
COMMANDS / TESTS REQUIRED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

After patching, run in repository root:

```bash
python -m compileall app
```

Import smoke test:

```bash
python -c "from app.core.repository import Repository; print(Repository)"
```

Service smoke test:

```bash
python -c "from app.core.services import ProductService; service = ProductService(); print(type(service.repository)); service.close()"
```

Repository read smoke test:

```bash
python -c "from app.core.repository import Repository; repo = Repository(); print(repo.count_products()); repo.close()"
```

Application boot test:

```bash
python -m app.main
```

If package entrypoint is configured:

```bash
python -m app
```

No commands were run in this session because the available interface was GitHub file inspection/editing, not a local runtime shell.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
IMPLEMENTATION RISKS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Fixing only the missing class name may expose the recursive `cursor_execute` bug immediately.
2. Fixing `cursor_execute` may expose missing `row_to_*` mapper methods.
3. Adding mappers may expose schema/model naming mismatches.
4. Promotion-related repository methods may refer to undefined models or tables.
5. The current `RepositoryContract` is narrower than the full repository method set; extra methods may be acceptable, but contract coverage should remain coherent.
6. If `app/core/repository.py` was accidentally overwritten, reconstructing it manually risks losing intended methods unless old commit history is inspected.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
REMAINING UNCERTAINTIES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- Whether `CHAT_BEHAVIOUR.md` and `CHAT_PROTOCOL.md` are missing, renamed, or not committed yet.
- Whether `04_TODO.md` and `10_ACTIONS.md` were intentionally retired after the DEV_STAGE migration.
- Whether a previous correct version of `app/core/repository.py` exists in Git history and should be restored instead of manually rebuilt.
- Whether `Promotion` is part of the current MVP schema/model set or leftover planned functionality.
- Whether `app/core/__init__.py` is intentionally absent.
