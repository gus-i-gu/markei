# Foundational Computer Science

## &&&01
### Responsibility Boundary
#### Description
A responsibility boundary identifies which component should know, decide, or perform a kind of work.
#### Formal Definition
An explicit allocation of knowledge and behavior to a component or layer, together with constraints on what belongs elsewhere.
#### Practical Example
A screen gathers input, a service coordinates a use case, and a repository stores data.
#### Language Implementation
Python expresses boundaries through packages, modules, classes, imports, interfaces, and method calls.
#### Project Implementation
Markei separates desktop presentation, `ProductService`, `Repository`, database lifecycle, packaging, installer placement, validation evidence, and Main/human acceptance.
#### Required Concepts
None.
#### Related Concepts

## &&&02
### Raw Data Versus Derived Data
#### Description
Source facts and values calculated from those facts have different evidential roles.
#### Formal Definition
Raw data is directly entered, observed, imported, or retrieved; derived data is produced through calculation, aggregation, filtering, formatting, prediction, or interpretation.
#### Practical Example
A receipt purchase is a source event; an expected next-purchase date is derived from history.
#### Language Implementation
Both may be represented by fields or keys, so naming, ownership, recalculation, and persistence rules preserve the distinction.
#### Project Implementation
Markei treats purchases as historical events and product summaries, status labels, and projections as derived or cached interpretations.
#### Required Concepts
`&&&01`.
#### Related Concepts
`&&&03`, `&&&05`, `&&%02`, `&%%04`.
#### Status

## &&&03
### Naming as Data Contract
#### Description
Names communicate the expected meaning of data and project states across boundaries.
#### Formal Definition
The use of stable, precise, responsibility-aware names to define the meaning and shape of exchanged information.
#### Practical Example
`configured`, `built`, `launched`, `installed`, `validated`, and `accepted` are not interchangeable labels.
#### Language Implementation
Naming contracts appear in attributes, signatures, dictionary keys, constants, settings keys, artifacts, and status reports.
#### Project Implementation
Markei keeps Product code, local reference code, nickname, UUID, selection, details, Item addition, occurrence time, insertion time, observed facts, and derived estimates as distinct contracts.
#### Required Concepts
`&&&01`.
#### Related Concepts
`&&&02`, `&&&05`, `&&%02`, `&%%04`.
#### Status
Yellow.
#### Source

## &&&04
### Resource Ownership and Lifetime
#### Description
Resources require an identifiable owner and a defined lifetime.
#### Formal Definition
Resource ownership assigns creation, use, sharing, and release responsibility; lifetime is the interval during which a resource remains retained and valid.
#### Practical Example
A repository owns a database connection, while the application composition determines when all repositories close.
#### Language Implementation
Python expresses lifetime through constructors, `close()`, context managers, `try/finally`, event hooks, and composition.
#### Project Implementation
A bounded, idempotent `MainWindow.closeEvent()` closes all four page-owned services. Source/frozen and installed close/reopen evidence passed, while human-visible walkthrough remains pending.
#### Required Concepts
`&&&01`.
#### Related Concepts
`&&%03`, `&&&05`, `%%%02`, `&%%06`.
#### Status

## &&&05
### Evidence State and Validation Boundary
#### Description
A claim is limited by the strongest evidence actually obtained. Configuration, artifact creation, execution, deployment, validation, and acceptance are distinct states.
#### Formal Definition
An evidence state records what has been demonstrated; a validation boundary identifies the exact environment, lifecycle stage, conditions, and behavior covered by that evidence. Evidence from one boundary cannot automatically prove another.
#### Practical Example
A compiled installer proves artifact creation; it does not by itself prove installation, workflow behavior, retention, or acceptance.
#### Language Implementation
Projects encode evidence through command results, artifact inspection, hashes, logs, test results, environment records, and explicit acceptance decisions.
#### Project Implementation
Cycle 06 progressed from installer configuration to compiled installer, per-user installation, Start Menu launch, technical workflow persistence, close/reopen, same-version reinstall, uninstall retention, and reinstall recovery. Automated installed-lifecycle evidence is strong, but human-visible UI acceptance and SmartScreen behavior remain pending or unknown; `accepted: no`.
#### Required Concepts
`&&&01`, `&&&02`, `&&&03`.

# Python Language Concepts

## &&%01
### Package and Module Boundary
#### Description
A module groups definitions in one file; a package groups related modules under an import namespace.
#### Formal Definition
A module is an importable unit normally represented by a `.py` file; a package is an importable namespace containing modules or subpackages.
#### Practical Example
Business services and database infrastructure may share a package while retaining separate responsibilities.
#### Language Implementation
Python boundaries use directories, package markers, imports, and module-level names.
#### Project Implementation
Markei uses `app/core`, `app/database`, and `app/desktop`; physical grouping does not erase semantic responsibility.
#### Required Concepts
`&&&01`.
#### Related Concepts
`&&%02`, `&&%04`, `&%%01`, `&%%03`.
#### Status

### Dataclass as Structured Data Carrier
#### Description
A dataclass concisely defines objects whose main role is carrying named data.
#### Formal Definition
A class declaration enhanced by generated initialization, representation, comparison, and related data-oriented behavior.
#### Practical Example
A purchase object carries product, date, quantity, and price without owning SQL.
#### Language Implementation
Python uses `@dataclass`, typed fields, and optionally `slots=True`.
#### Project Implementation
Markei defines `Category`, `Store`, `Product`, and `Purchase` as slotted dataclasses while persistence and workflows remain elsewhere.
#### Required Concepts
`&&&01`, `&&&03`.
#### Related Concepts
`&&&02`, `&%%04`.
#### Status
Yellow.
#### Source

## &&%03
### Context Manager and Deterministic Cleanup
#### Description
A context manager ties setup and cleanup to a visible scope; long-lived applications may require an explicit lifecycle event instead.
#### Formal Definition
An object implementing context management so setup occurs on entry and cleanup on exit, including exceptional exit.
#### Practical Example
A short database operation can use `with`; a desktop session may close repositories during window shutdown.
#### Language Implementation
Python uses `with`, `__enter__`, `__exit__`, `try/finally`, and explicit `close()` methods.
#### Project Implementation
Markei uses explicit service closure in `MainWindow.closeEvent()`. Automated installed close and immediate reopen passed after the Sprint 01 correction.
#### Required Concepts
`&&&04`.
#### Related Concepts
`&&&05`, `%%%02`, `&%%06`.
#### Status

## &&%04
### Source, Frozen, and Installed Execution Context
#### Description
The same application can run from repository source, a collected executable distribution, or an installer-placed distribution. These contexts share business architecture but differ operationally.
#### Formal Definition
Source execution runs modules and resources through a development interpreter; frozen execution runs collected code and resources through a generated executable; installed execution runs that frozen runtime after installer-controlled placement, registration, and launch-path creation.
#### Practical Example
`python main.py`, `dist/Markei/Markei.exe`, and a Start Menu shortcut start the same application through different execution contexts.
#### Language Implementation
Python applications distinguish contexts through entrypoints, `sys.frozen`, `_MEIPASS`, resource resolution, collected dependencies, and platform-specific writable paths.
#### Project Implementation
Source and frozen execution were previously evidenced. Sprint 02 added actual installed execution from a Start Menu shortcut under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Markei`, without requiring a Python command or source checkout.
#### Required Concepts
`&&&01`, `&&%01`, `%%%05`.

# Target-File and Architecture Concepts

## &%%01
### Application Service
#### Description
An application service coordinates a user-facing use case without becoming presentation or persistence infrastructure.
#### Formal Definition
A boundary object that orchestrates domain and persistence operations to fulfill application use cases.
#### Practical Example
Receipt registration validates input, records a purchase, recalculates summaries, and returns results without exposing SQL to the UI.
#### Language Implementation
Commonly a class whose methods represent use cases and depend on repositories.
#### Project Implementation
`ProductService` coordinates commands, calculations, settings, stores, and UI-facing projections.
#### Required Concepts
`&&&01`, `&&%01`.

## &%%02
### Repository Pattern and Persistence Adapter
#### Description
A repository translates application-oriented persistence operations into storage operations.
#### Formal Definition
A persistence abstraction that maps application requests and representations to database commands and results.
#### Practical Example
A service asks for purchases; the repository runs SQL and returns mapped results.
#### Language Implementation
Python repositories commonly contain parameterized SQL, cursor execution, commits, and row mapping.
#### Project Implementation
Markei's `Repository` owns SQL, mappings, one connection, one cursor, and individual commits; database setup remains in `app.core.database`.
#### Required Concepts
`&&&01`, `&&&02`, `&%%01`.
#### Related Concepts
`%%%02`, `%%%03`, `&%%05`.
#### Status
Yellow.

## &%%03
### Presentation Adapter
#### Description
A presentation adapter translates platform input into application calls and application results into rendering.
#### Formal Definition
A component that converts platform-specific interaction into application-boundary calls and representations.
#### Practical Example
A page reads widgets, calls a service, and renders prepared data.
#### Language Implementation
PySide6 uses widgets, layouts, signals, slots, event handlers, and dialogs.
#### Project Implementation
Markei pages call `ProductService`; automated Sprint 02 evidence exercised the same service/database path, but a full human-visible UI walkthrough remains pending.
#### Required Concepts
`&&&01`, `&&%01`, `&%%01`.
#### Related Concepts

## &%%04
### Database Row, Domain Model, and View Model
#### Description
Overlapping information may appear in representations shaped for persistence, application meaning, or presentation.
#### Formal Definition
A database row is a persistence representation, a domain model is an application entity representation, and a view model is a use-case-specific rendering representation.
#### Practical Example
Stored numbers become a Product object and then formatted Lists labels.
#### Language Implementation
Python may use `sqlite3.Row`, dataclasses, dictionaries, `TypedDict`, or dedicated view models.
#### Project Implementation
Sprint 02 technical evidence included persisted product/purchase rows plus Lists, History, and Settings projections.
#### Required Concepts
`&&&02`, `&&&03`, `&&%02`, `&%%01`.
#### Related Concepts
`&%%03`, `%%%03`.
#### Status

---

## &%%05
### Statement Atomicity Versus Workflow Atomicity
#### Description
One database statement can be atomic while a multi-step use case remains non-atomic when its steps commit separately.
#### Formal Definition
Statement atomicity is all-or-nothing execution of one statement; workflow atomicity is all-or-nothing execution of a complete use case within one transaction boundary.
#### Practical Example
Creating a product, adding a purchase, and updating a summary may leave partial state if each commits independently.
#### Language Implementation
SQLite workflow atomicity uses transaction boundaries, commits, rollbacks, and service/repository coordination.
#### Project Implementation
Markei receipt registration and deletion/recalculation remain multi-commit workflows. Sprint 02 success does not remove this inherited debt.
#### Required Concepts
`&&&01`, `&%%01`, `&%%02`.
#### Related Concepts
`&&&05`, `%%%02`.
#### Status

## &%%06
### Packaging and Installation Artifact Lifecycle
#### Description
Packaging and installation move through distinct configurations, generated artifacts, deployed states, and lifecycle evidence.
#### Formal Definition
A release artifact lifecycle transforms source configuration into a frozen distribution, installer configuration into a compiled installer, and that installer into an installed application whose reinstall, uninstall, recovery, and retained-data behavior require separate validation.
#### Practical Example
A `.spec` file is not an executable; an executable directory is not an installer; installer source is not compiled setup media; installation is not lifecycle acceptance.
#### Language Implementation
Projects use packaging specifications, build wrappers, generated distributions, installer definitions, compiler outputs, installation metadata, and lifecycle tests.
#### Project Implementation
Sprint 02 produced `dist/installer/Markei-Setup-0.1.0-x64.exe`, installed files under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Markei`, validated same-version reinstall, removed installed files during uninstall while retaining `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Markei`, and recovered retained data after reinstall.
#### Required Concepts
`&&&01`, `&&&04`, `&&%04`, `%%%05`.
#### Related Concepts
`&&&05`, `%%%06`.
#### Status

# Packages, Dependencies, and SQLite Concepts

## %%%01
### SQLite Initialization Versus Migration
#### Description
Initialization creates a new database; migration changes an existing database while preserving compatible user state. Seeding inserts predefined rows.
#### Formal Definition
Initialization establishes baseline persistence, migration transforms existing persistence, and seeding inserts optional predefined records into an initialized structure.
#### Practical Example
A first launch creates tables; migration ensures required defaults; a development fixture may insert sample rows.
#### Language Implementation
Python may use `connect`, `executescript`, schema inspection, conditional DDL, idempotent inserts, and commits.
#### Project Implementation
Production includes `schema.sql` and excludes `seed.sql`. Sprint 02 showed that category `F` / `General` and store `1` / `Default Store` are required structural defaults, created idempotently without sample products or purchases.
#### Required Concepts
`&&&01`, `&%%02`.

## %%%02
### SQLite Connection and Cursor Ownership
#### Description
A connection owns SQLite session and transaction state; a cursor is a connection-bound execution interface.
#### Formal Definition
A connection is the runtime object owning database-session state and transaction context; a cursor executes statements and traverses results through that connection.
#### Practical Example
Four repositories can hold four independent database sessions.
#### Language Implementation
Python uses `sqlite3.Connection` and `sqlite3.Cursor`, explicit commit/rollback, row factories, PRAGMAs, and close operations.
#### Project Implementation
Each Markei repository opens one connection and cursor. The four page-owned chains closed successfully during automated installed close/reopen validation.
#### Required Concepts

## %%%03
### SQLite PRAGMA and Connection Configuration
#### Description
SQLite behavior is partly configured per connection.
#### Formal Definition
PRAGMA statements inspect or modify SQLite metadata and connection/database behavior; centralized configuration applies expected settings to each connection.
#### Practical Example
Foreign keys, WAL, synchronous mode, and named row access are configured separately.
#### Language Implementation
Python uses connection execution and `row_factory` assignment.
#### Project Implementation
Markei enables foreign keys, requests WAL, uses synchronous `NORMAL`, and configures `sqlite3.Row`.
#### Required Concepts
`%%%02`.
#### Related Concepts
`%%%01`, `%%%04`, `&%%04`.
#### Status
Yellow.
#### Source
Current connection configuration.

---

## %%%04
### Relational Schema and Referential Integrity
#### Description
A relational schema defines tables, columns, keys, relationships, and constraints.
#### Formal Definition
Referential integrity requires foreign-key references to correspond to valid records or permitted null states.
#### Practical Example
A purchase references a product and follows declared update/delete behavior.
#### Language Implementation
SQLite uses `CREATE TABLE`, keys, indexes, nullability, and foreign-key actions.
#### Project Implementation
The fresh-production Register failure exposed that required category/store references must exist before inserting a purchase-backed product workflow.
#### Required Concepts
`&&&01`, `&%%02`.

## %%%05
### Bundled Resource Versus Writable User Data
#### Description
Replaceable application resources and persistent mutable user state have different locations and lifecycles.
#### Formal Definition
A bundled resource is supplied with the application runtime; writable user data is created or modified during use and persists independently from installed program files.
#### Practical Example
A schema script travels with the application while the user's database belongs in a per-user directory.
#### Language Implementation
Python resolves source/frozen resources through paths and runtime indicators, while user data uses platform directories or environment variables.
#### Project Implementation
Installed program files under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Markei` were removed by uninstall, while `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Markei\market.sqlite` remained and was recovered after reinstall. `schema.sql` is bundled, `seed.sql` is excluded, and logs/WAL/SHM remain writable external state.
#### Required Concepts
`&&&04`, `%%%01`.
#### Related Concepts

#### Status
Yellow.
#### Source

## %%%06
### Build-Time, Runtime, and Installer-Time Dependency
#### Description
Dependencies belong to different lifecycle stages and must not be treated as one undifferentiated requirement set.
#### Formal Definition
A build-time dependency produces a frozen artifact; a runtime dependency supports the executing application; an installer-time dependency compiles or executes installation tooling.
#### Practical Example
A packaging tool may exist only on the builder, collected GUI libraries support the executable, and an installer compiler produces setup media.
#### Language Implementation
Projects separate dependency manifests, build commands, collected modules/native libraries, and external compiler discovery.
#### Project Implementation
PyInstaller produced the frozen runtime; collected PySide6/Qt components support execution. Inno Setup 6.7.3 was installed per-user and discovered at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe`; it compiled the installer but is not required by the installed Markei application.
#### Required Concepts

### Stable Identity
#### Description
An identity remains stable when mutable labels change.
#### Formal Definition
A durable identifier that refers to one logical subject independently of changeable descriptive attributes.
#### Practical Example
An account number remains the same after its contact email changes.
#### Language Implementation
Dart can represent UUID identities with immutable typed value objects.
#### Project Implementation
Markei uses opaque UUIDs for relational identity, immutable user-established Product codes, and generated `@001` / `#001` local organizational references; nicknames remain labels.

### Authentication
#### Description
Authentication establishes evidence that a caller controls an identity.
#### Formal Definition
The verification of credentials or factors that produces an authenticated principal or session.
#### Practical Example
Verified sign-in proves control of an account before protected requests are accepted.
#### Language Implementation
Flutter obtains and securely retains an access token through a selected authentication provider.
#### Project Implementation
Verified email resolves an authenticated Markei account UUID; email is not the ownership key.

### Authorization
#### Description
Authorization determines what an authenticated principal may do.
#### Formal Definition
A policy decision that permits or rejects an operation by a principal on a resource.
#### Practical Example
A signed-in account may read its own records but not another account's records.
#### Language Implementation
The Flutter client presents a token; the API performs authorization rather than trusting client claims.
#### Project Implementation
Markei scopes shared events to the authenticated account; row ownership is an authorization example.

### Eventual Consistency
#### Description
Replicas may differ temporarily yet converge after synchronization.
#### Formal Definition
A consistency model in which replicas receiving and deterministically applying the same accepted facts eventually reach equivalent state.
#### Practical Example
An offline device shows older data until it reconnects and catches up.
#### Language Implementation
Flutter persists a cursor, downloads unseen events, and rebuilds local projections deterministically.
#### Project Implementation
Markei devices converge on catalogue, purchases, and Storage/Shortage/Market projections after sync.

### Historical Integrity
#### Description
Later changes must not silently rewrite the meaning of accepted history.
#### Formal Definition
The preservation of original identities and authoritative observations required to interpret past events reproducibly.
#### Practical Example
A package-size change creates a new identity instead of altering an old receipt.
#### Language Implementation
Immutable Dart identities and append-only events preserve earlier references.
#### Project Implementation
Registered Purchases retain Product and optional archived-reference identities, the buying occurrence, and Item facts without being rewritten by later labels, insertion time, or projections.

### Immutable Dart Model
#### Description
An immutable Dart model represents state through fixed fields and replacement values.
#### Formal Definition
A typed Dart object whose identity-bearing state cannot mutate after construction.
#### Practical Example
A corrected value is created as a new object rather than editing the original instance.
#### Language Implementation
Dart uses `final` fields, const-capable constructors, value equality, and copy/replacement patterns.
#### Project Implementation
Markei event envelopes, catalogue identities, Money, and Quantity are modeled as immutable values.

### Reusable Catalogue
#### Description
A reusable catalogue stores recurring account-private identities separately from purchases.
#### Formal Definition
An owner-scoped reference set whose entities can be reused by multiple historical transactions.
#### Practical Example
Several receipts reference the same household product identity.
#### Language Implementation
Dart repositories and use cases expose immutable catalogue models to Flutter.
#### Project Implementation
Markei reuses account-private Products across Purchases; selecting a Product, opening Product details, autofilling exact facts, and adding a staged Item are separate actions.

### Product Identification Set and Deterministic Normalization
#### Description
A product identity is derived from exact normalized identity facts, not fuzzy similarity.
#### Formal Definition
A deterministic mapping from an account-scoped canonical attribute tuple to one stable Product ID.
#### Practical Example
Mechanically equivalent 350 g and 0.350 kg inputs resolve to one packaged identity.
#### Language Implementation
Pure Dart normalization converts text, dimensions, units, and amounts before UUID derivation.
#### Project Implementation
New Products require an immutable visible Product code. Exact code lookup is distinct from PACKAGED/BULK exact identity and advisory similarity; no route auto-merges Products.

### Purchase Aggregate
#### Description
A Purchase owns one consistency boundary for receipt registration.
#### Formal Definition
An aggregate root that enforces invariants and atomic change across its members and required persistence effects.
#### Practical Example
A receipt header and all valid lines commit together or none commit.
#### Language Implementation
A Dart Purchase command coordinates models and repository transaction through one use case.
#### Project Implementation

### Purchase Item
#### Description
A Purchase Item records one product-specific commercial observation within a Purchase.
#### Formal Definition
An aggregate member that references a catalogue Product and carries transaction-specific quantity and price facts.
#### Practical Example
One receipt line records two packages of a product and its line total.
#### Language Implementation
An immutable Dart item model belongs to a Purchase aggregate model.
#### Project Implementation
PACKAGED Items distinguish package quantity, packages bought, amount and total; BULK Items own amount, same-unit price rate and the derived line total.

### Append-Only Synchronization Event
#### Description
An accepted synchronization fact is appended rather than overwritten.
#### Formal Definition
An immutable, uniquely identified protocol fact that is validated and applied deterministically.
#### Practical Example
A `purchase.registered` event remains in history after acceptance.
#### Language Implementation
Dart encodes an immutable event envelope to a language-neutral payload.
#### Project Implementation
Markei synchronizes one atomic Purchase with immutable Purchase Item lines as the first event.

### Offline Queue and Idempotent Delivery
#### Description
Durable pending work can be retried without duplicate effect.
#### Formal Definition
A persistent queue combined with event uniqueness and content rules so repeated logical submission is equivalent to one acceptance.
#### Practical Example
A lost response causes retry of the same event, not creation of a second order.
#### Language Implementation
Flutter stores pending events locally and retries the same UUID and payload.
#### Project Implementation
Markei returns prior acceptance for identical retries and rejects changed content under an accepted event UUID.

### Device Ordering and Synchronization Cursor
#### Description
Device creation order and server download order are distinct.
#### Formal Definition
A device-monotonic sequence records local event order while an opaque server cursor identifies accepted-event download position.
#### Practical Example
A device fills a sequence gap while another client pages after its last server cursor.
#### Language Implementation
Dart persists device sequence and account cursor independently of occurrence time.
#### Project Implementation
Markei rejects/request gaps and downloads account-scoped accepted events in bounded cursor pages.

### Sync Protocol
#### Description
A sync protocol defines stable cross-runtime exchange behavior.
#### Formal Definition
A versioned contract governing identities, payloads, validation, authorization, retries, ordering, cursors, errors, and compatibility.
#### Practical Example
Two applications interpret one accepted message and error code identically.
#### Language Implementation
Dart client DTOs exchange language-neutral JSON with a TypeScript API that validates runtime payloads.
#### Project Implementation
Markei's custom API owns token validation, idempotent append, cursor download, protocol versions, and stable errors.

### Dimensional Quantity
#### Description
A quantity combines magnitude with an explicit physical dimension and unit.
#### Formal Definition
A fixed-precision amount qualified by measurement kind and canonical unit.
#### Practical Example
One litre is VOLUME/L and is not inferred to equal one kilogram MASS/KG.
#### Language Implementation
Dart can use immutable Quantity values and enums for MASS/KG, VOLUME/L, and COUNT/UNIT.
#### Project Implementation
Markei separates Product package amount, Item package count, purchased amount, measurement kind and unit; BULK rate must use the same selected unit as its amount.
#### Required Concepts
`&&&03`, `&&%05`.
#### Related Concepts

### Monetary Minor Unit
#### Description
Money is represented by currency plus an integer smallest-unit amount.
#### Formal Definition
A monetary value composed of an explicit currency code and integer count of its minor unit.
#### Practical Example
BRL 8.79 is represented as BRL and 879 minor units.
#### Language Implementation
Dart uses an immutable Money value rather than binary floating-point for ordinary currency facts.
#### Project Implementation
Markei derives BULK line total from fixed-point amount and same-unit rate, rounds half-up to currency minor units, and presents the result read-only.
#### Required Concepts
`&&&03`, `&&%05`.
#### Related Concepts

## &%%17
### Versioned Analytic
#### Description
Analytical rules evolve through new versions without rewriting source facts.
#### Formal Definition
A derived algorithm identified by stable name and immutable semantic version, with results reproducible from authoritative inputs.
#### Practical Example
An improved price-change formula becomes version 2 while version 1 keeps its meaning.
#### Language Implementation
A Dart analytics registry selects pure algorithms by identifier/version and validates them with fixtures.
#### Project Implementation
Markei derives Lists from registered history: zero observations mean `No Purchase history`, one compatible observation means `Not enough history`, and projected statuses never become measured inventory.
#### Required Concepts
`&&&02`, `&&&10`.
#### Related Concepts
`&%%16`, `&&&05`.

### Flutter Framework and Responsive Widget Composition
#### Description
Flutter composes one client presentation across platform-appropriate layouts.
#### Formal Definition
A framework-managed widget tree that renders application state responsively under platform constraints and lifecycle events.
#### Practical Example
A wide layout uses a navigation rail while a phone uses compact navigation.
#### Language Implementation
Flutter supplies widgets, constraints, navigation, lifecycle hooks, plugins, and platform build targets; Dart remains the language.
#### Project Implementation
Markei has responsive navigation and a partial theme/component foundation, but page-level target composition, keyboard equivalence, screen-reader behavior, and visual convergence remain unvalidated.
#### Required Concepts

# Canonical Boundary

Cycle 07 Sprint 02 introduces the Flutter shared-beta model concepts as **Red** because model-design discussion establishes reusable concept identity, not learner mastery. No existing maturity changed. Authoritative Fact / Derived Projection remains owned by `&&&02`; Purchase atomicity extends `&%%05`; Row Ownership remains an Authorization example; composition root and lifecycle remain related to existing responsibility/resource concepts; protocol versioning belongs to `&%%14`; storage-schema versioning remains related to `%%%01`; and append-only event identity remains distinct from Dart immutability.

# Cycle 07 Sprint 03 Local Evidence Reconciliation

> Evidence source: `DEV_STAGE/H_DDC_CODEX.md` and Main J §19  
> Evidence class: implemented and unit-tested locally; platform and distributed behavior remain unvalidated  
> Maturity effect: none

Local executable evidence now strengthens the project manifestations of:

```text
&&&06 Stable Identity
&&&10 Historical Integrity
&&%05 Immutable Dart Model
&%%07 Reusable Catalogue
&%%08 Product Identification Set and Deterministic Normalization
&%%09 Purchase Aggregate
&%%10 Purchase Item
&%%11 Append-Only Synchronization Event
&%%12 Offline Queue and Idempotent Delivery
&%%15 Dimensional Quantity
&%%16 Monetary Minor Unit
&%%17 Versioned Analytic
%%%07 Flutter Framework and Responsive Widget Composition
```

The evidence demonstrates immutable Dart domain/value objects, account-private catalogue identities, PACKAGED/BULK rules, dimensional quantities, integer minor-unit money, aggregate validation and rollback, atomic persistence of Purchase/Items/local event/pending queue, close/reopen preservation, and a minimal identifier/version analytics registry. Drift is implemented for the fresh local foundation. Flutter scaffolding and tests execute, while responsive composition and target-platform runtime do not.

Evidence limits remain canonical:

- `&%%08`: normalization passes basic unit-equivalence fixtures, but Unicode/Portuguese behavior and cross-language canonical bytes remain provisional.
- `&%%12`: an offline queue row is prepared atomically; real server retry/idempotency is not implemented.
- `&%%13`: device/cursor structure is partial and repeated device sequence likely resets; monotonic ordering is not established.
- `&%%14`: JSON files are versioned semantic fixtures/contract examples, not a complete validated sync protocol.
- `&&&07`, `&&&08`, and `&&&09`: authentication, authorization, and eventual consistency remain unimplemented.
- `%%%07`: Flutter framework setup is evidenced; Windows, Android, iOS, responsive UI, and lifecycle execution remain host-unvalidated.
- Schema version 1 supports fresh creation; upgrade/migration recovery is unvalidated.

No status changes. Project execution evidence is not explicit learner evidence.

# Cycle 07 Sprint 04 Local Workflow Evidence Reconciliation

> Evidence sources: `DEV_STAGE/H_DDC_CODEX.md`, Main J §21, current Flutter source/tests, and `contracts/shared_beta/v2/`  
> Evidence class: implemented and tested locally, with Windows host validation  
> Maturity effect: none

Sprint 04 strengthens project evidence for `&&&06`, `&&&10`, `&&%05`, `&%%07`–`&%%13`, `&%%15`–`&%%17`, and `%%%07`. Product code, immutable local record UUID, and versioned semantic identification are now separate responsibilities. NFKC-based normalization, PACKAGED/BULK rules, atomic Purchase/event/queue persistence, monotonic device sequencing, v1-to-v2 migration, multi-item Flutter workflow, local history, and Windows build/launch evidence are implemented and tested within the reported boundary.

Canonical limits remain:

- `&%%08`: deterministic normalization is evidenced in Dart and fixtures, but cross-language parity and any future central catalogue assignment remain unproved.
- `&%%12`: durable queue creation and rollback are local delivery preparation; server retry/deduplication is absent.
- `&%%13`: per-device monotonic allocation is now locally evidenced; no server cursor exists.
- `&%%14`: v2 JSON Schemas and examples define a stronger structural contract, not a complete implemented Sync Protocol.
- `&&&07`, `&&&08`, and `&&&09`: authentication, authorization, and eventual consistency remain unimplemented.
- `%%%07`: responsive widget behavior and Windows execution are evidenced; Android is tooling-blocked, iOS host-unvalidated, and manual UI acceptance open.
- A future central Product UUID is not the user Product code or current local Product record UUID and remains deferred.

No KANBAN status changes. Implementation evidence is not learner evidence.

# Cycle 07 Sprint 05 Android Evidence Reconciliation

> Evidence sources: `DEV_STAGE/H_DDC_CODEX.md`, Main J §24, current source/tests/Android configuration, and human-observed emulator workflow  
> Evidence class: implemented, automated-test evidenced, host-executed, and selectively human-observed  
> Maturity effect: none

Sprint 05 strengthens project manifestations of `&&&06 Stable Identity`, `&%%09 Purchase Aggregate`, `&%%11 Append-Only Synchronization Event`, `&%%12 Offline Queue and Idempotent Delivery`, `&%%13 Device Ordering and Synchronization Cursor`, `&&&10 Historical Integrity`, and `%%%07 Flutter Framework and Responsive Widget Composition`.

Stable distinctions now evidenced in the project:

- Android application ID identifies the installed package/sandbox; display label names it to the user.
- `local-account` is a provisional local data-owner placeholder, not authentication.
- the Device ID is a database-owned installation-local UUID v4 reused across reopen; it is not the package name, emulator serial, hardware identity, Account ID, Product identity, Purchase ID, or Event UUID.
- Device sequence orders events within one Device; it is not event identity or a server cursor.
- Product user code, local Product UUID, semantic identification facts, Purchase UUID, and Event UUID retain separate responsibilities.
- Purchase registration creates a new immutable Purchase aggregate. No supported Purchase-upsert/replacement semantics are evidenced.

Canonical evidence limits:

- phone-width widget execution is automated Flutter evidence, not real Android lifecycle or final visual-design validation;
- emulator build/install/launch/interaction evidence does not establish physical-device compatibility;
- process restart/database inspection is partial lifecycle/persistence evidence; the complete keyboard, Back, rotation, background/resume, text-scale, and process-recreation matrix remains provisional;
- local event and pending queue persistence remain synchronization preparation only;
- responsive functional scaffold evidence does not establish accepted UI/UX or accessibility quality;
- authentication, authorization, eventual consistency, complete Sync Protocol behavior, production Android release, physical-device validation, and iOS remain unimplemented, host-unvalidated, or deferred as applicable.

No KANBAN status changes. Human-observed application use is project evidence; no explicit learner explanation or transfer evidence supports a maturity transition.

# Intermid Recovery ProductReference Evidence Reconciliation

> Evidence sources: `DEV_STAGE/H_DDC_CODEX.md`, `[M]_STAGE/J_MAIN_STAGE.md` §§20–25, current `purchase_page.dart`, and `markei_app_test.dart`  
> Evidence class: implemented and locally widget-tested for the existing-Product edit path  
> Maturity effect: none

The corrected staged-Item edit path strengthens the project manifestations of `&&&06 Stable Identity`, `&%%07 Reusable Catalogue`, and `&%%10 Purchase Item` without creating a new concept.

Accepted project distinction:

- `ProductReference` identifies the Product subject retained by the staged line.
- Product label accompanies that retained reference for presentation.
- package count, purchased quantity, unit, and line total are editable Purchase Item values.
- a stable draft-line key identifies the line in the widget list; it does not substitute for Product identity.
- saving an edit reuses the retained Product reference rather than inferring identity from current form or dropdown state.

The focused regression directly validates `ExistingProductReference`: after editing Item values and registering, the Purchase Item keeps the original Product ID and no duplicate Product row is created. The shared source path retains the base `ProductReference` and therefore structurally covers `NewProductReference`, but that variant has no separate focused regression.

No KANBAN status changes. Repository behavior and passing tests strengthen project evidence only; learner maturity still requires explicit explanation, comparison, prediction, or transfer.

# Cycle 10 Canonical Reconciliation

> Reconciliation date: 2026-07-30
> Evidence: `13_LECTURE_REGISTER.md` Observation 010; `REC_LEGACY.md`
> Records 001–021 and Appendix I; current J mutable prefix §§2–5.2
> Maturity result: no transition

Cycle 10 did not create a new Didactic concept identity. It corrected or
extended the current canonical wording of existing concepts while preserving
their standing maturity. Observation 010 remains the chronological owner; this
section owns only the stable concept and evidence boundaries.

| Existing concept identifier | Previous canonical wording | Corrected or extended canonical wording | Exact Cycle 10 evidence | Maturity before → after |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `&&&05`, `&%%14` | Evidence boundaries and Sync protocol were defined generally. | Readiness is a bounded prerequisite/control result; ordinary Sync separately requires upload, download, durable local apply/cursor progress and acknowledgement. | REC 001–006; Observation 010 progression 1–2; J §§2–3 | Red / Red → unchanged |
| `&&&05`, `&&&10` | Historical integrity preserved source facts; evidence state bounded claims. | A current action result names the correctly associated newest action terminal. Preserved historical operation evidence remains useful but does not override that terminal. | REC 001–008; Observation 010 progression 3 and misconception table; J §3 | Red / Red → unchanged |
| `&%%05`, `&&&05`, `&&&10` | Workflow atomicity distinguished multi-step commit scope; evidence/history rules were general. | Transaction outcome and diagnostic-persistence outcome are independent evidence dimensions. A trusted response or committed effect is not erased by a later failure to persist or render diagnostics. | REC 019–020; Observation 010 progression 5; J §§3–4 | Red / Red / Red → unchanged |
| `&&&03`, `&&&06`, `&%%08`, `&%%11` | Product code, stable UUID, normalized Product identity and Event identity existed as separate descriptions. | Product natural identity reconciles exact semantic Product facts; it is not the user-visible Product code, local Product UUID or append-only Event UUID. None may substitute for another. | REC 018–021; Observation 010 progression 4; J §3 | Yellow / Red / Red / Red → unchanged |
| `&&&03`, `&&&05`, `&%%12`, `&%%14` | Retry/idempotency and protocol outcomes were described without the final five-state learner vocabulary. | `blocked` means a prerequisite prevented a phase; `not-applied` means no business effect committed; `applied` means the intended effect committed; `duplicate-equivalent` means replay caused no second effect; `unknown` means evidence cannot classify the outcome. | REC 001–012 and Appendix I; Observation 010 progression 6 | Yellow / Red / Red / Red → unchanged |
| `&&&09`, `&%%13`, `&%%14` | Eventual consistency and cursor ordering named exchange progress. | Acknowledgement may occur only after downloaded facts are durably applied and cursor progress is committed. It is not proof of all-Device convergence or backup. | REC 019–021; Observation 010 progression 7; J §3 | Red / Red / Red → unchanged |
| `&&&05`, `&&&09`, `&%%14` | Synchronization evidence was bounded but did not encode the final assay distinction. | Same-Device hosted proof and reciprocal two-Device convergence are different evidence classes. Two-Device proof requires both directions, stable projections, drained queues and idempotent no-op repeats. | REC 009–017 and 021; Observation 010 progression 8; J §§2–3 | Red / Red / Red → unchanged |
| `&&&05`, `%%%07` | Automated, platform and human evidence were already non-equivalent. | Tests/builds establish their named automated boundary; a controlled human assay establishes only its recorded practical scope. Neither establishes learner mastery without direct explanation, prediction, debugging or transfer. | REC 018–021; Observation 010 progression 9 and comprehension boundary; J §§3, 7 | Red / Red → unchanged |
| `&&&05` | Validation was limited by environment and scope. | Development acceptance and production acceptance are distinct. GCM03 proves only two Devices, one Account and the named development topology. | REC 021 and Appendix I; Observation 010 progression 10 and evidence ceilings; J §2 | Red → Red |
| `&&&05`, `&&&09`, `&%%14` | Logs, tests and runtime results were evidence sources. | Client declarations, server logs and provider inspection are distinct evidence sources. One cannot be inferred from another, and an omitted final provider recount remains explicitly absent. | REC 018–021; Observation 010 practical assay lessons and evidence ceilings; J §§3–4 | Red / Red / Red → unchanged |

Canonical Cycle 10 evidence ceilings remain:

```text
GCM02=CLOSED_HOSTED_SAME_DEVICE_SCOPE
GCM03=CLOSED_TWO_DEVICE_DEVELOPMENT_SCOPE
MVP_SYNC_ACCEPTANCE=PASS_TWO_DEVICE_ONE_ACCOUNT_DEVELOPMENT_SCOPE
PRODUCTION_ACCEPTANCE=ABSENT
```

The evidence does not establish multiple-Account isolation, revocation, outage
recovery, retention/rebootstrap or production lifecycle readiness.

# C11-PH01-S01 Canonical Absorption

> Evidence: `DEV_STAGE/H_DDC_CODEX.md`; J mutable prefix §§2, 5.2, 7–8;
> `13_LECTURE_REGISTER.md` Observation 011
> Evidence class: implemented, widget-tested and Windows/Android build-validated
> for the named presentation scope
> Maturity result: no transition

| Existing concept identifier | Previous canonical wording | Corrected or extended canonical wording | C11-PH01-S01 evidence | Maturity before → after |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `&&&03`, `%%%07` | Naming and responsive composition were general UI contracts. | Ordinary destination labels and one primary Home action expose page purpose without internal maturity labels. Home presents local-first Purchase registration before secondary Catalogue, Lists and History inspection. | H “Wording And Labels”; Home/widget tests and builds summarized in H | Yellow / Red → unchanged |
| `&&&02`, `&%%17` | Lists was a derived projection with zero/one-history boundaries. | Lists is explicitly an estimated Purchase-history projection, never recorded inventory. `Estimate`, `Approximate`, `Unavailable`, `Not enough history` and `Expected ended` retain projection-qualified meaning. | H “Wording And Labels” and “State Distinctions”; Lists tests | Yellow / Red → unchanged |
| `&&&03`, `&&&05`, `&%%17` | Error, empty and projection states were not canonically enumerated. | Loading, local read error, first-use empty, filtered empty, insufficient history and populated data are distinct states. Read-error Retry repeats a read-only local projection request and states local data was not changed. | H “State Distinctions”; focused Lists tests | Yellow / Red / Red → unchanged |
| `%%%07`, `&&&05` | Responsive equivalence and accessibility remained broadly unvalidated. | Wide tables and compact cards must preserve the same information/search/sort state. Breakpoint and 200-percent text-scale tests are automated evidence only; Narrator, TalkBack, keyboard-only and real-device acceptance remain absent. | H “Accessibility Evidence And Limits”; breakpoint/text-scale tests | Red / Red → unchanged |
| `&&&03`, `&&&05`, `&%%17` | Versioned Analytics existed as a concept; future destination labels could imply implementation. | Analytics is reserved for PH02 without implying active calculations or telemetry. Audit is reserved for PH03 without implying diagnostic migration. | H “Wording And Labels” and “Requested But Not Implemented”; J §7 | Yellow / Red / Red → unchanged |

No learner explanation, page-comprehension assay or transfer evidence was
recorded. All maturity values remain exactly as before this reconciliation.

# C11-PH01-R01 and C11-PH02 Canonical Absorption

> Maturity result: no transition

The implementation represents and executes the following existing concepts.
It does not prove that a learner can explain, compare, predict, debug or
transfer them. No new concept identifier is required.

| Existing concept identifier | Stable canonical identity or dependency | Evidence-qualified C11 absorption | Maturity before → after |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `&&&02`, `&&&10`, `&%%17` | Purchase history is the factual basis for derived local projections. | Analytics reads Account-scoped local Purchase evidence. History may hand off typed Purchase IDs, but History performs no calculation. | Yellow / Red / Red → unchanged |
| `&&&03`, `&&&05` | Learner-facing names and evidence limits must remain honest. | Twelve evidence fields are visible: Purchase, date/time, Product, Brand, Store, purchased by, purchased for, payment method, quantity, unit price, line total and promotion. Unsupported values remain explicitly unavailable rather than repaired or invented. | Yellow / Red → unchanged |
| `&&&05`, `&&&09`, `&%%14` | Claims are bounded by their actual local authority. | Analytics is deterministic, local, Account-scoped and non-remote. It does not use Sync, telemetry, provider facts or external facts. | Red / Red / Red → unchanged |
| `&&&02`, `&%%05`, `&%%17` | A derived view depends on named factual inputs and valid operations. | Each session-local card has one determinant—Product, Purchase, Store or UTC Time—one or more relational variables, one operation, an optional Time condition and traceable selected or filtered evidence. | Yellow / Red / Red → unchanged |
| `&&&03`, `&&&05`, `&%%17` | Terms must distinguish grouping, comparison and scope. | Sum is total contribution; Mean is average contribution; Difference is comparison B minus baseline A; Percentage is a part of a named containing whole and never percentage change. | Yellow / Red / Red → unchanged |
| `&&&05`, `&%%05`, `&%%17` | Invalid derivations must not masquerade as facts. | Missing facts, invalid combinations, zero denominators and numeric overflow produce typed unavailable outcomes with factual explanations. No raw fact is repaired. | Red / Red / Red → unchanged |
| `%%%07`, `&&&05` | Responsive/accessibility evidence is distinct from semantic parity. | Wide tables and compact cards preserve field meaning, selection, focus/reset and card evidence traceability. Automated breakpoint, keyboard/focus and 200-percent text evidence does not establish assistive-technology, locale, screenshot, real-device or human comprehension acceptance. | Red / Red → unchanged |

Stable operating boundaries:

- evidence pages contain 100 rows;
- selected scope is bounded to 500 Purchase IDs;
- cards are session-local and repeatable;
- selecting matrix evidence initializes a card, card evidence focuses the matrix,
  and reset restores all evidence;
- Analytics contains no charts, forecasting, prediction, rankings,
  recommendations, causal claims or telemetry.

All 39 KANBAN maturity values remain unchanged. Implementation, tests and build
artifacts establish project execution only; the direct learner evidence required
by the standing promotion rubric is absent.
