accepted: no
SmartScreen visible behavior: unknown
```

## Evidence State
**KANBAN ID:** `&&&05`  
The strongest truthful claim supported by observed evidence. Sprint 02 reached compiled installer, installed execution, technical workflows, retention, and recovery.

## Validation Boundary
**KANBAN ID:** `&&&05`  
The environment, lifecycle stage, conditions, and behavior covered by evidence. Automated service-backed workflow evidence is not a complete human UI walkthrough.

## Source Execution
**KANBAN ID:** `&&%04`  
Repository modules run through a development Python interpreter.

## Frozen Application
**KANBAN ID:** `&&%04`  
A generated executable distribution containing collected code, resources, and runtime dependencies.

## Installed Application
**KANBAN ID:** `&&%04`  
A frozen runtime placed and registered through an installer. Markei was launched through its Start Menu shortcut under the current ordinary Windows user.

## Packaging Artifact
**KANBAN ID:** `&%%06`  
The generated one-folder distribution produced from `Markei.spec`.

## Installer Configuration
**KANBAN ID:** `&%%06`  
Source instructions for producing setup media. `installer/Markei.iss` is configuration, not the installer executable.

## Installer Artifact
**KANBAN ID:** `&%%06`  
Compiled setup media. Sprint 02 produced `dist/installer/Markei-Setup-0.1.0-x64.exe`.

## Installed Program Files
**KANBAN ID:** `&%%06`, `%%%05`  
Replaceable application files placed under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Markei`.

## Retained User Data
**KANBAN ID:** `%%%05`  
Mutable state under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Markei`. The database survived uninstall and reopened after reinstall.

## Structural Default
**KANBAN ID:** `%%%01`  
A required baseline row or setting needed for valid application operation. Category `F` / `General` and store `1` / `Default Store` are structural defaults, not sample business data.

## Seed Data
**KANBAN ID:** `%%%01`  
Optional predefined rows used for development, testing, or demonstrations. Production excludes `seed.sql`.

## Build-Time Dependency
**KANBAN ID:** `%%%06`  
A dependency required to produce the frozen artifact. PyInstaller is the Markei example.

## Runtime Dependency
**KANBAN ID:** `%%%06`  
A dependency required by the executing application. Collected PySide6/Qt components are Markei examples.

## Installer-Time Dependency
**KANBAN ID:** `%%%06`  
A dependency required to compile installation tooling. Inno Setup's `ISCC.exe` is installed on the builder and is not required by installed Markei.

## Same-Version Reinstall
**KANBAN ID:** `&%%06`  
Reapplying the same installer identity/version. Sprint 02 observed retained compatible data.

## Uninstall Retention
**KANBAN ID:** `&%%06`, `%%%05`  
Removal of installed program files while preserving accepted external user state. Markei's database remained after uninstall.

## Reinstall Recovery
**KANBAN ID:** `&%%06`, `%%%05`  
Reinstalling program files and reopening previously retained compatible user data.

## Windows Reputation Observation
**KANBAN ID:** `&&&05`  
A platform-security or reputation observation distinct from application correctness. Defender was enabled and binaries were unsigned; human-visible SmartScreen behavior remains unknown.

# Existing Retrieval Terms

- **Responsibility boundary** — allocation of knowledge and behavior. `&&&01`
- **Naming as data contract** — precise labels preserve meaning. `&&&03`
- **Resource ownership and lifetime** — creation, use, and release responsibility. `&&&04`
- **Deterministic cleanup** — release tied to a visible scope or lifecycle event. `&&%03`
- **Statement versus workflow atomicity** — one statement can be atomic while a multi-step use case is not. `&%%05`
- **SQLite initialization versus migration** — fresh structure versus compatible adaptation; seeding is distinct. `%%%01`
- **SQLite connection ownership** — session and cursor lifetime. `%%%02`
- **Bundled resource versus writable user data** — replaceable application content versus retained mutable state. `%%%05`

# Supervision Notes

- `02_KANBAN.md` remains authoritative.
- No concept became Green.
- Installed technical validation does not prove learner mastery.
- Human-visible Register, Lists, History, Settings, close/reopen, and SmartScreen observations remain learner-facing evidence gaps.
- Tool names remain project examples rather than standalone concepts.

<!-- TEMPORAL_MARKER:C07-S02-CLOSURE -->

# Sprint 05 Current-Evidence Retrieval

## Platform Evidence Ladder
**KANBAN ID:** `%%%07`  
Flutter SDK selection, Android SDK recognition, emulator availability, APK build, install, launch, interaction, lifecycle, and persistence are different evidence levels. Sprint 05 reached emulator launch and human-observed registration, with only partial lifecycle evidence.

## Android Application ID and Display Label
**KANBAN IDs:** `%%%07`, `&&&06`  
`com.gusigu.markei` identifies the installed Android package and sandbox. `Markei` is the visible label. Neither identifies the account, device, Product, Purchase, or event.

## Installation-Local Device UUID
**KANBAN IDs:** `&&&06`, `&%%13`  
A UUID v4 stored in the app-private database identifies one local installation for event sequencing. Tests show reuse after reopen and distinct identities for distinct fresh databases. It is not authentication or a hardware ID.

## Identity Taxonomy
**KANBAN IDs:** `&&&06`, `&%%07`–`&%%11`, `&%%13`  
Account ID owns local data provisionally; Device UUID owns one installation’s sequence; Product user code is a visible account-private reference; Product UUID identifies a local record; Purchase UUID identifies one registered aggregate; Event UUID identifies one event/delivery fact; Device sequence orders that Device’s events.

## Purchase Registration
**KANBAN IDs:** `&%%09`, `&%%10`, `&&&10`  
Current source creates and inserts a new immutable Purchase aggregate. “Upsert” is not supported terminology for replacing an existing Purchase.

## Local Queue Is Not Synchronization
**KANBAN IDs:** `&%%11`–`&%%14`, `&&&09`  
A local event and pending row prepare later delivery. They do not prove API upload, server idempotency, cursor download, replay, conflict handling, or convergence.

## Phone-Width Widget Evidence
**KANBAN ID:** `%%%07`  
A widget test demonstrates that the controlled Purchase/History path works at a narrow logical width. It does not prove Android keyboard, Back, rotation, background/resume, process recreation, physical-device compatibility, or final visual quality.

## Functional UI Scaffold
**KANBAN ID:** `%%%07`  
SafeArea, scrolling, staged total, and navigation support the bounded workflow. The scaffold is implemented and usable for evidence gathering, while visual design and accessibility acceptance remain provisional.

## Evidence Is Not Mastery
**KANBAN IDs:** all referenced concepts  
Source representation, passing tests, host execution, and human-observed application use strengthen project evidence. Maturity changes require explicit learner evidence such as explanation, comparison, or transfer.

# Intermid Recovery Current-Evidence Retrieval

## ProductReference Identity Versus Editable Item Values
**KANBAN IDs:** `&&&06`, `&%%07`, `&%%10`  
A `ProductReference` identifies which reusable Product a staged Purchase Item concerns. Package count, purchased quantity, unit, and line total are transaction-specific Item values and may change without changing Product identity. A draft-line key identifies the staged line, not the Product.

## Existing-Product Edit Evidence
**KANBAN IDs:** `&&&05`, `&&&06`, `&%%10`  
The focused widget regression edits Item values, registers the Purchase, verifies the original Product ID, and verifies that only one Product row exists. This is direct evidence for `ExistingProductReference`; the shared reference-polymorphic source path for `NewProductReference` remains source-structure evidence without a separate regression.

## Project Evidence Is Not Learner Maturity
**KANBAN IDs:** all referenced concepts  
Implementation, widget tests, and analysis show that the distinction exists and behaves within the tested boundary. Maturity still requires the learner to explain or transfer the distinction independently.
